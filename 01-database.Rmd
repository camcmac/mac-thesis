## Abstract  

- Humans have created a novel habitat in the ocean through the discharge of artificial materials like plastics, rubber, and manufactured wood products. The organisms that live and circulate through the marine environment in this new form of habitat have been identified, described, and otherwise published in the scientific record in growing numbers over the past 30 years. Comprehensively collating these records with their standardised taxonomy and corresponding spatial coordinates may aid in efforts to understand this ecosystem and its potential impacts on the rest of the marine environment. 
- This database includes `r organism_count` of these recorded instances of organisms on anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) from `r paper_count` papers in every ocean basin, as well as the Mediterranean and several other seas published between 1992 and 2019.
- Records were pulled from peer-reviewed scientific publications found using tailored keyword searches in Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest.  
- Papers returned in the initial queries were then manually assessed for their relevance according to their title and abstract. Those identified as potentially relevant were then read by the researchers to locate and incorporate relevant data included in the text, figures, tables, and appendices into the database. The results of this effort were then joined with validated taxonomic nomenclature from the World Register of Marine Species, Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and  Integrated Taxonomic Information System. The broad marine region specified in each publication was manually noted along with the available spatial coordinates for the study as a whole from in-text description and georeferenced maps.
- The resulting database can be accessed from the stable link provided along with this publication.  
- Combining the taxonomic information in this database with trait or behavioural databases, such as XXXX, could yield insights into how these ecosystems assemble and function. Further detail could be added and spatial analysis performed by merging this database with oceanographic data available from XXXX or XXXX.

## Background & Summary  
- Popularisation of plastic as a material for diverse uses in our daily lives has lead to a large and increasing amount of artificial materials in the world's oceans. Collectively referred to as anthropogenic marine debris (AMD), these substrates comprised of plastics, rubber, and manufactured wood products, among other solid wastes from human activities in oceans and seas, also represent a novel type of habitat that is growing increasingly common. [cite]   
- Scientific literature documented organisms associated with AMD as early as the 1970's [cite], with more frequent and detailed records growing in number since the 1990's [cite]. Researchers investigating the phenomenon of plastic pollution across its varied dimensions have often included secondary remarks of life attached to their study materials. A smaller subset of researchers has specifically studied the organisms themselves. Due to the diverse nature of the disciplines and modalities, records vary significantly across all meaningful dimensions, from collection methods through to how they are reported.  
- Previous efforts towards compiling these records have resulted in several review papers [cites]. In one case, collaboration across disciplines resulted in a comprehensive database of all organisms attached to catalogued debris suspected to originate from the 2015 tsunami that occurred along the coast of Japan's Tohuku prefecture [cite]. This database however, represents the first resource tailored for analysis of organisms associated with AMD globally from a comprehensive search of scientific publications and includes all of the records from these cited previous efforts. 
- The database also not only contains records of identified organisms, but further includes information on methodology, substrate materials, and spatial co-ordinates. However, these variables were often only reported at the study level and not associated with individual organisms. Associations between them and the organisms are therefore not suitable for investigation using most types of statistical analysis.  
- Taxonomic identifications of organisms in their source material have been joined to their currently accepted nomenclature as of March 2020 available from specialist-maintained open taxonomic databases and include stable identifiers. Substrate materials as reported in the literature have also been associated with standardised contemporary nomenclature from IUPAC [cite] and the DOI or ISBN is included for each publication within the database. Where relevant, each variable in the database has been named according to the Darwin Core Standard [cite]. This has all been done to facilitate the use of this database alongside others and as disciplines inevitably update their nomenclature.  
- It may be useful to combine this database with others containing more detailed data on the organisms' evolutionary biology, physical traits, behaviour, or ecological function. Spatial analyses may georeference the coordinates of this database into marine regions of varying scope, such as through almanacs available through XXXX [cite].  
- Used alone, this database shows an increasing scientific interest in this novel ecosystem and changes in the way that it is studied. Molecular techniques have yielded a boom in the known diversity of organisms on AMD, particularly for bacteria and fungi. It also highlights the need for more research in the Southern Hemisphere and research in general. Almost all organisms were recorded only once or twice.  
- While this database has the potential to yield important findings, its sparse nature relative to the known diversity of organisms and environments in the world's oceans is also likely to support the need for more research across disciplines. 
- In its current state, it may be particularly useful for those researching the impacts of AMD on coastal environments. This database can be easily combined with new findings to provide background and context. It may also be useful for tracking the locations or spread of invasive species for biosecurity researchers and marine resource managers.  
- Trends found in this database should be presented with the caveat that there is an immense number of potential external sources that could not be captured or reported.  Findings related to materials should be carefully considered because reporting of which organisms was attached to which substrate was so rarely done that it could not be reliably recorded in this database. Spatial trends should also be considered judisciously due to the lack of tie between specific points and organisms. Studies with large spatial scopes should be removed prior to any spatial analysis. It is also worth noting that data from the Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris (JTMD) database [cite], paper ID 999, has far more detailed and validated records than any other, which may skew results from the North Pacific unless accounted for.  
- The database is separated into five primary tables linked by two primary identifiers (Table XX). Identifiers are unique keys at the highest record levels: study and accepted taxonomic nomenclature. Study level variables include data that was reported most often in the methods section of the paper, like methodology and sampling locations. While material types were reported in the results section, these too were often reported at the level of the study itself and are therefore linked to the unique study identifier. Both accepted and utilised taxonomic nomenclature for the most detailed identification available, or lowest taxonomic unit (LTU), of every identified organism is the second primary identifying key. This links each organism to its correct nomenclature and enables systematic validation and updates as necessary.  
- All of the data originates in peer-reviewed scientific literature published and returned in searches for the specified queries in three major research repositories (Table XX) between 1992 and 2019. Organisms were recorded on debris items collected from, or deliberately immersed and naturally colonised in, the marine environment during the course of formal scientific research. The database contains records from all marine environments globally, from beaches to salt marshes and deep sea trenches. It only contains what the researchers reported in their publications, not neccessarily all of the organisms found or identified. 
- It is recommended that users of this database update the taxonomic nomenclature using the noted databases and database IDs provided. Where material types are relevant, it is also recommended to reference current IUPC nomenclature and ensure that materials are described using contemporary naming conventions. Spatial coordinates are provided with descriptive quality ratings to assist in analyses where accuracy is important. However, no particular level of accuracy is guaranteed. For a guide on how to join the different tables, see the diagram included in Appendix XX. 
- This database is provided in static format at the stable location associated with this publication. Any dynamic or updated versions of this database should reference this publication and be discoverable using that reference.
- At the time of this publication there is no update schedule and no plans exist to provide this resource in any other format.

In the austral summer of 2007/08 Greenpeace and British Antarctic Survey ships ({MV} Esperanza and {RRS} James Clark Ross respectively) conducted the ﬁrst co-ordinated joint marine debris survey of the planet’s most remote seas around East and West Antarctica to reveal ﬂoating macroplastics. With observations also made from the ice patrol vessel {HMS} Endurance in the same season and seabed samples collected from the {RRS} James Clark Ross, this was the widest survey for plastics ever undertaken around Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Plastics pollution in coastal areas is one of the topics that have received more attention over the past few years. The intertidal zone is a waters area that is directly affected by contamination of plastic waste from land and sea. The purpose of this study was to analyze the types and abundance of plastic waste in the intertidal zone and its impact on macrozoobenthos abundance. This research was conducted at Pesisir Desa Jaring Halus in February-April 2017. Macrozoobenthos and macro - micro plastic were collected by using quadratic transect. Sediments were collected with a core, to a depth of 30 cm. Microplastic and macroplastic abundances were analyzed using separation of sediment density and hand sorting. The dominant micro plastic types were film (52.30\%), fiber (24.88\%), fragments (22.74\%), followed by pellets (0.1\%). The total number of microplastics were 326,33 items and macro plastic were 308 items. Macroplastic abundance is positively correlated with microplastic (0.765). The abundance of macrozoobenthos is negatively correlated with microplastic abundance (-0.368) and with macro plastic abundance (-0.633). The management strategies were suggested clean up marine debris, decrease plastic using and built up the station of debris processing.},

	abstract = {In this explorative study we applied a set of uni- and bi-variate diversity metrics (α-diversity, Whittaker β-diversity, γ-diversity, Whittaker plot) to two sampled ‘communities’ of anthropogenic beach litter. Meso-litter represented the ‘species’ with the highest number of items. Comparing the two sampled sites, we observed different values in total number of items, in α-, β- and γ-diversity and in the shape of Whittaker plot: we think that these results might have implication for assessing the impact of marine litter and the necessary operation measures aimed to its removal: (i) the higher is the amount of litter, the higher the effort in its removal, (ii) the higher is the α- and γ-diversity, the higher the number of tools and equipment to differentiate it, (iii) Shannon index, evenness and β-diversity provide interesting information on, respectively, diversity of sources, their frequency distribution and turnover, so implying different impacts on specific sensitive targets in different sites and the necessity of oriented operational actions. Moreover, the higher is the β-diversity, the higher the heterogeneity of litter with implication on a possible change of resources and equipment involved. Although we highlighted some caveat in the use and misuse of diversity metrics in beach litter management, we suggest further application of these indices to beach litter ‘communities’ to build a general conceptual framework in this sense.},

The overall mean was about 5 and 3 items/m2 in 1994 and 1995, respectively. Approximately a total of 14,000 m2 were examined and a total of 101,000 items were noted, 67,000 during 1994 and 34,000 in 1995. More than 50\% of the litter was plastic and the remainder wood, glass, cardboard, Styrofoam, metal and other materials. Most litter appears to be from local land-based or near shore sources, although there are some regional inﬂuences as well. The main local sources are the passenger port, the cargo port and the beach goers. The ﬁndings are compared with other regions of the world. The amount of litter is related to distance of the beach from the main sources, and shape, physiography and orientation of the beach. Spatial and seasonal variations are examined and discussed, and actions and measures to combat the problem on local and regional levels are suggested.},

	volume = {46},
	abstract = {In the last half century the ubiquity, abundance and ‘ecological problem’ of synthetic debris has grown from negligible to global concern. Plastics are accumulating in considerable amounts even on the most remote island shores, mid-ocean, polar-regions and even on the seabed deeper than the continental shelf. Recent aircraft losses over oceans, and the search for any wreckage have led to public airing of satellite imagery of just how common and dense artefacts are in the sea. Patterns of accumulation have been examined, monitored and modeled by many researchers and patterns in the larger fragment sizes of plastic (mega, macro and meso-) are reported here for the South Atlantic Ocean. The implications of plastic debris inundating even non-urban environments are considerable, and it has led to massive entanglement, chocking, poisoning and change in the distribution possibilities of organisms. Many organisms (especially those with sessile adult phases) have had their dispersal possibilities greatly expanded by plastic debris. There is much more plastic afloat than natural flotsam, it is easy to colonise, may stay buoyant for decades and, at least in theory, can travel to anywhere from anywhere (rather than port to port as most ships do). Bryozoans, colonial and clonal benthic animals, are one particular taxon which have taken great advantage of this new habitat and as such have the potential to establish as aliens, possibly invasive pests, in many locations. Here the risk to mid Atlantic island and Southern Ocean coasts are highlighted – places with currently few if any marine aliens and rich, endemic faunas.},

Here we present a combined open-ocean and remote coasts marine debris survey of the Atlantic (from 68°S–78°N). Daily shipboard observations were made from the Southern Ocean to the high Arctic and the shores of 16 remote islands were surveyed. We report (1) anthropogenic debris from the most northerly and southerly latitudes to date, (2) the ﬁrst record of marine biota colonising debris at latitudes {\textgreater}68°, and (3) the ﬁnding of exotic species (the barnacle Elminius modestus) on northern plastic debris. Plastic pieces dominated both openocean and stranding marine debris. The highest densities of oceanic debris were found around northwest Europe, whereas the highest stranding levels were equatorial. Our ﬁndings of high east-Arctic debris colonisation by fauna contrast with low values from west Arctic (though only two samples) and south Atlantic shores. Colonisation rates of debris diﬀered between hemispheres, previously considered to be similar. Our two South Atlantic mega-debris shipboard surveys (10 years apart) found no changes in openocean debris densities but resurvey of a {UK} and an Arctic island both found increases. We put our ﬁndings in the context of the Atlantic literature to interpret spatial and temporal trends in marine debris accumulation and its organismal consequences.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the amount of text available for organizational science research has grown tremendously. Despite the availability of text and advances in text analysis methods, many of these techniques remain largely segmented by discipline. Moreover, there is an increasing number of open-source tools (R, Python) for text analysis, yet these tools are not easily taken advantage of by social science researchers who likely have limited programming knowledge and exposure to computational methods. In this article, we compare quantitative and qualitative text analysis methods used across social sciences. We describe basic terminology and the overlooked, but critically important, steps in pre-processing raw text (e.g., selection of stop words; stemming). Next, we provide an exploratory analysis of open-ended responses from a prototypical survey dataset using topic modeling with R. We provide a list of best practice recommendations for text analysis focused on (1) hypothesis and question formation, (2) design and data collection, (3) data pre-processing, and (4) topic modeling. We also discuss the creation of scale scores for more traditional correlation and regression analyses. All the data are available in an online repository for the interested reader to practice with, along with a reference list for additional reading, an R markdown file, and an open source interactive topic model tool ({topicApp}; see https://github.com/wesslen/{topicApp}, https://github.com/wesslen/text-analysis-org-science, https:// dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?{persistentId}=doi:10.15139/S3/R4W7ZS).},

Waste and litter production (amount and composition) were aﬀected by urbanization and varied during the summer. Urban beaches had higher densities of waste deposition and lower percentages of organic, domestic and other miscellaneous waste than urbanized beaches. Litter characteristics were also inﬂuenced by type of beach, and varied during the season as a consequence of beach use and cleaning practices, but not environmental factors. Urbanized beaches obtained higher scores for aesthetic quality of sand than urban beaches, and small-sized litter tended to accumulate during the season in the beach of Lloret Centre. The most important problems are management of recyclable materials, litter left by users on the sand, and separation of sand from litter. In addition, current eﬃciency of mechanical cleaning is low, especially in the withdrawal of cigarette butts. These analyses highlight problems that should be addressed in future management of area beaches.},

Sea voyages, coastal conservation and remote island visits started raising awareness of the problems of rubbish at sea in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans. Household plastic items are now chieﬂy made in {SE} Asia and their use in that area where there is a very large human population density in contact with a large coastline results in disposable plastic items entering the surrounding seas. Surveys from Negombo in West Sri Lanka, Ari Atoll in the Maldives, Pemba Island in North Tanzania, Christmas Island, Cocos Island, Quirimba Island in North Mozambique, Rodrigues Island, Nosy Ve in South-West Madagascar and Inhaca Island in South Mozambique are reported. The accumulation of durable rubbish reaching even remote mid Ocean islands such as Christmas and Cocos islands is high and much of what was found stranded on shores was colonized by animals. The vast amounts of waterborne debris is almost certainly drastically changing opportunities for many marine organisms to travel and thus for exotic invaders to spread. Supralittoral hermit crabs on such remote Indian Ocean shores are even starting to use debris instead of the more usual gastropod shells as debris is so abundant.

	abstract = {Background: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the ﬁrst register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered.
Results: There are w226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (w20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are w170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 6 0.2 million marine species. On average 37\% (median 31\%) of species in over 100 recent ﬁeld studies around the world might be new to science.
Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.},

The litter was collected in clean up voluntary campaigns that took place in the period between 25 August 2003 and 29 February 2004. A total of 10,506 items weighing 1159 kg were collected during the survey. Mean litter density in the individual sampling sites varied between 1 and 6 items/m2 with an overall mean density of 2.8 items/m2. The mean weight of the collected items per sampling site varied between 0.06 and 1.06 kg/m2 with an overall mean of 0.31 kg/m2. Plastic accounted for 42\% of the collected items, ﬁshing gear was the second most abundant (31\%) while metal was the third most abundant item (17\%). By comparison, cardboard constituted 1\%, and rubber and other items accounted for less than 1\% of the total items collected during the campaigns. Approximately 61\% of the plastics consisted of bags followed by bottles (24\%), plastic containers and sheets accounted for 13 and 2\%, respectively. Statistical analysis indicates no signiﬁcant differences between the sites in terms of litter count and weight. Potential sources are pointed out and recommendations and actions to address the problem are suggested.},

	abstract = {Marine litter has been deﬁned as solid materials of human origin discarded at sea, or reaching the sea through waterways. The effect of marine debris on wildlife, tourism and human health is well documented and there is considerable scientiﬁc literature about plastic litter in the sea and over the seabed, mostly highlighting the possible impact on marine mammals and tourism. Dispersal of marine and terrestrial organisms on ﬂoating objects has biogeographical and ecological interest. For some species, extension of their geographical range is more likely to be related to transport of mature individuals on ﬂoating rafts than to the active or passive dispersal of reproductive propagules. Variability and variety of rafting materials has increased dramatically in recent years and marine litter has been used widely as a raft by ‘hitch-hiking’ species. This paper reports on the benthic invertebrates living on marine debris transported by wind and surface currents over the western Mediterranean Sea. Plastics accounted for the major item of debris because of poor degradability, however glass, cans, ﬁshing nets and polyurethane containers, were also found. Macro-benthos living on raft material comprised mainly molluscs, polychaetes and bryozoans. Large ﬁsh were found commonly below large plastic bags. Estimations of the distances that may be covered by hitch-hiking species and the contribution of rafting to the theoretical dispersal of species is provided.},

Using marine organisms as bioindicators of plastic pollution can provide crucial information that would better integrate the spatial and temporal presence of plastic debris in the sea. Given their long and frequent migrations, numerous marine species that ingest plastics can provide information on the presence of plastic debris but only on large spatial and temporal scales, thus making it diﬃcult to identify quantitative correlations of ingested plastics within well-deﬁned spatio-temporal patterns. Given the complex dynamics of plastics in the sea, the biomonitoring of marine plastic debris should rely on the combination of several bioindicator species with diﬀerent characteristics that complement each other. Other critical aspects include the standardization of sampling protocols, analytical detection methods and metrics to evaluate the eﬀects of ingested plastics in marine species.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Given the complexity of quantitative collection, knowledge of the distribution of microplastic pollution in many regions of the world ocean is patchy, both spatially and temporally, especially for the subsurface environment. However, with knowledge of typical hydrodynamic behavior of waste plastic material, models predicting the dispersal of pelagic and benthic plastics from land sources into the ocean are possible. Here we investigate three aspects of plastic distribution and transport in European waters. Firstly, we assess patterns in the distribution of plastics found in fluvial strandlines of the North Sea and how distribution may be related to flow velocities and distance from source. Second, we model transport of non-buoyant preproduction pellets in the Nazaré Canyon of Portugal using the {MOHID} system after assessing the density, settling velocity, critical and depositional shear stress characteristics of such waste plastics. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of surface turbulences and high pressures on a range of marine plastic debris categories (various densities, degradation states and shapes tested) in an experimental water column simulator tank and pressure laboratory. Plastics deposited on North Sea strandlines varied greatly spatially, as a function of material composition and distance from source. Model outputs indicated that such dense production pellets are likely transported up and down canyon as a function of tidal forces, with only very minor net down canyon movement. Behaviour of plastic fragments under turbulence varied greatly, with the dimensions of the material, as well as density, playing major determining roles. Pressure was shown to affect hydrodynamic behaviours of only low density foam plastics at pressures ≥ 60 bar.},

	abstract = {Marine plastic debris has become a signiﬁcant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known, however, about its inﬂuence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the “great Paciﬁc garbage patch.” The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2 to 5 mm and Ͼ5 mm) ranged from 0.35 to 3.7 particles {mϪ}3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Paciﬁc Ocean. Net community oxygen production ({NCP} ϭ gross primary production Ϫ community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas {NCP} in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from the surrounding picoplankton and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with signiﬁcantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes, and {nifH} genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions, and nitrogen ﬁxation. In aggregate, our ﬁndings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways, and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from those of free-living planktonic microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic Marine Debris ({AMD}) is one of the most important pollutants in the oceans. Millions of tons of debris across oceans have created a critical environmental problem. This study presents a novel method aimed to improve the identiﬁcation of macroplastics through remote sensing over beaches, combining {AMD} hyperspectral laboratory characterization and digital supervised classiﬁcation in high spatial resolution imagery. Several samples were collected from the Chiloé Island beaches, Chile. Spectral signature samples and physical properties were assessed through laboratory work. {HyLogger}3® ({CSIRO}), {PS}-300 Apogee and {ASD} Field Spec hyperspectral systems were used to characterize each sample. Using those measurements, a spectral library was generated by processing, ﬁltering and sorting the spectral data gathered, determining distinctive spectral bands for digital classiﬁcation. By using this spectral library, a digital classiﬁcation method was implemented over World-View 3 imagery, covering the three beaches selected as test sites. Distinct classiﬁcation methods and geospatial analyses were applied to determine land cover composition, aimed for the detection of Styrofoam and the rest of anthropogenic marine debris. Four ﬁeld campaigns were carried out to validate the {AMD} classiﬁcation and mass retrievals, performed on {\textgreater} 300 ground based points. The {AMD} hyperspectral library was successfully applied for an {AMD} digital classiﬁcation in satellite imagery. Support Vector Machine method showed the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy equivalent to 88\% and over 50 tons of debris estimated on the pilot beaches. These results prove the feasibility of quantifying macro-{AMD} through the integration of hyperspectral laboratory measurements and remote sensing imagery, allowing to estimate anthropogenic inﬂuence on natural ecosystems and providing valuable information for further development of the methodology and sustainable {AMD} management.},

	abstract = {Coastal urban infrastructures are proliferating across the world, but knowledge about their emergent impacts is still limited. Here, we provide evidence that urban artiﬁcial reefs have a high potential to accumulate the diverse forms of litter originating from anthropogenic activities around cities. We test the hypothesis that the structural complexity of urban breakwaters, when compared with adjacent natural rocky intertidal habitats, is a driver of anthropogenic litter accumulation. We determined litter abundances at seven sites (cities) and estimated the structural complexity in both urban breakwaters and adjacent natural habitats from northern to central Chile, spanning a latitudinal gradient of {\textasciitilde}15 (18S to 33S). Anthropogenic litter density was signiﬁcantly higher in coastal breakwaters when compared to natural habitats ({\textasciitilde}15.1 items {mÀ}2 on artiﬁcial reefs versus 7.4 items {mÀ}2 in natural habitats) at all study sites, a pattern that was temporally persistent. Different litter categories were more abundant on the artiﬁcial reefs than in natural habitats, with local human population density and breakwater extension contributing to increase the probabilities of litter occurrence by {\textasciitilde}10\%. In addition, structural complexity was about two-fold higher on artiﬁcial reefs, with anthropogenic litter density being highest at intermediate levels of structural complexity. Therefore, the spatial structure characteristic of artiﬁcial reefs seems to enhance anthropogenic litter accumulation, also leading to higher residence time and degradation potential. Our study highlights the interaction between coastal urban habitat modiﬁcation by establishment of artiﬁcial reefs, and pollution. This emergent phenomenon is an important issue to be considered in future management plans and the engineering of coastal ecosystems.},

These materials continue to accumulate in the environment, mainly in rivers and oceans, in the form of macro to nanoplastics. Over the past decade, increased scientiﬁc interest has produced an expanding knowledge base for microplastics. However, analysis of the plastic-associated microbial community (the plastisphere) in the intertidal zone is rare. The aim of the research presented here was to investigate the concentration of microplastic in the benthic sediment of Vitória Bay estuarine system ({SVB}), {SE} Brazil. The microplastic concentrations in the Vitória Bay bottom sediments ranged from 0 to 38 particles per sample, with a total of 247 particles. Synthetic ﬁbers from ﬁshing nets accounted for 77\% of the microplastic observed in the studied area. The scanning electron micrographs revealed that, while bacteria were the main colonizers of the {SVB} microplastic particles, fungal ﬁlaments and spores were also apparent.},

The ﬁrst part examines the inﬂuence of equilibrium wind-waves on vertical tracer distributions, based on large eddy simulations ({LESs}) of the wave-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. Motivated by observations of buoyant microplastic marine debris ({MPMD}), this study applies the {LES} model and the parametric one-dimensional column model from part one to examine the vertical distributions of {MPMD}. {MPMD} is widely distributed in vast regions of the subtropical gyres and has emerged as a major open ocean pollutant whose distribution is subject to upper ocean turbulence. The models capture shear-driven turbulence, Langmuir turbulence ({LT}), and enhanced turbulent kinetic energy input due to breaking waves ({BWs}). Model results are only consistent with observations of {MPMD} proﬁles and the relationship between surface concentrations and wind speed if {LT} effects are included. Neither {BW} nor sheardriven turbulence is capable of deeply submerging {MPMD}, suggesting that the observed vertical {MPMD} distributions are a characteristic signature of wave-driven {LT}. Thus, this study demonstrates that {LT} substantially increases turbulent transport in the {OSBL}, resulting in deep submergence of buoyant tracers. The parametric model is applied to 11 years of observations in the North Atlantic and North Paciﬁc subtropical gyres to show that surface measurements substantially underestimate {MPMD} concentrations by a factor of 3–13.},

	abstract = {The Black Sea has a high risk of plastic pollution given the high river discharge of several industrialized countries into this semi-enclosed sea. Here, for the ﬁrst time, the occurrence and distribution of microplastics are reported for the Black Sea. Microplastics were assessed from zooplankton samples taken during two cruises along the south eastern coast of the Black Sea in the November of 2014 and February of 2015. In each cruise neuston samples were collected at 12 stations using a {WP}2 net with 200 mm mesh. Microplastics (0.2e5 mm) were found in 92\% of the samples. The primary shapes were ﬁbres (49.4\%) followed by plastic ﬁlms (30.6\%) and fragments (20\%), and no micro beads were found. Average microplastic concentration in November (1.2 ± 1.1 Â 103 par. {mÀ}3) was higher than in February (0.6 ± 0.55 Â 103 par. {mÀ}3). Reduced concentrations in February were possibly caused by increased mixing. The highest concentrations of microplastics were observed in offshore stations during November sampling. The heterogeneous spatial distribution (0.2 Â 103e3.3 Â 103 par. {mÀ}3 for all samples) and accumulation in some stations could be associated to transport and retention mechanisms linked with wind and the dynamics of the rim current, as well by different sources of plastic. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences in {MP} concentration between sampling stations and sampling periods (ttest, p {\textless} 0.05).The relatively high microplastic concentrations suggest that Black Sea is a hotspot for microplastic pollution and there is an urgency to understand their origins, transportation and effects on marine life.},

Derelict pots were widely distributed, but with notable hotspot areas, capturing 40 species and over 31,000 marine organisms. The target species, blue crab, experienced the highest mortality from lost pots with an estimated 900,000 animals killed each year, a potential annual economic loss to the ﬁshery of \$300,000. Important ﬁshery species were captured and killed in derelict pots including Atlantic croaker and black sea bass.

A total of 918 items were collected and sorted, with the highest concentration observed above 200 m depth. Overall, plastic was the dominant component of litter, followed by glass and metal. Comparing our results with other areas from the Mediterranean basin, Sardinian waters showed a lower impact, possibly as a consequence of multiple factors such as the lower human population density and the low ﬂow of the main rivers, among others.

The quantities of beach debris were estimated at 8865±1483 items km−1, with a corresponding weight of 54.83±8.58 kg km−1.

Plastic items were significantly higher (p{\textless}0.001) than any other type of debris on the beach during all the 3 months. The predetermined types of debris were also classified on the basis of their sizes. Metal, glass, paper, plastic and rubber items were largely smaller in size while styrofoam, masonry, processed wood and cloth items were mostly larger in size. The main sources of debris were restaurants, cafés and hawkers, which served food, beverages and mild stimulants in plastic, polystyrene and aluminum foil to the beach visitors.

However, there is a key knowledge gap on the impacts of marine litter in the Philippines – a country of high marine biodiversity and large exclusive economic zone. This gap is addressed here by using information shared on the internet by citizen scientists and conservation groups to assess the impacts of marine litter on megafauna. Facebook, presently the largest social media platform, was scanned for posts concerning the interaction between litter and marine species in the Philippines. Results showed thirty-two individuals from 17 species were aﬀected by marine litter in the country. Furthermore, ingestion (61\%) was the most frequent interaction reported. Mindanao was also identiﬁed as a hotspot for marine litter interactions. The study highlights the utility of social media in providing data to create an inventory of marine species adversely aﬀected by litter and the spatial distribution of these interactions.},

The dominant type of debris (89\%) was represented by ﬁshing gears, mainly lines, while plastic objects were recorded only occasionally. Abundant quantities of gears were found on rocky banks in Sicily and Campania (0.09–0.12 debris {mÀ}2), proving intense ﬁshing activity. Fifty-four percent of the recorded debris directly impacted benthic organisms, primarily gorgonians, followed by black corals and sponges.

Debris was categorized into three groups, ﬁshing line, ﬁshing net, and general rubbish. Overall, debris abundance across reefs was relatively low (average 0.5–3.3 items per survey (400 m2)), but not absent on remote reefs surveyed in the {GBR} region. Highest debris loads were recorded in {SEQ} near cities and high use areas.

	abstract = {Efﬁcient detection of food patches in oceanic areas by pelagic predators is often linked to large-scale physical structures (e.g. fronts, upwellings) that are usually rich and predictable. At smaller scales, however, predictability of resource becomes less clear because of the lability of smaller physical structures such as slicks and drift lines. Here, we explore how light levels and quantity of ﬂotsam affect the occurrence of foraging Yellow-bellied sea snakes (Pelamis platurus) on slicks. Although this pelagic species was formerly hypothesised to surface randomly and drift passively to reach slicks, our results show that foraging snakes are far more abundant on slicks if light levels are high and if slicks display ﬂotsam. The combination of both light and ﬂotsam should enhance the contrast between a potentially favourable slick and the adjacent waters as seen from an underwater viewpoint. Although our results do not unambiguously demonstrate the ability of Pelamis platurus to visually detect surface drift lines, they clearly suggest a role of both light levels and amount of ﬂotsam on surfacing decision. Accordingly, this hypothesis is supported by several complementary traits that are speciﬁc to this species. ‘Float-and-wait’ foraging undoubtedly requires efﬁcient detection of, and orientation to, oceanic slicks—processes that are likely less random and passive than formerly believed. Successful pelagic foraging is no doubt important to this species of sea snake that is the world’s most widely distributed snake species.},

	abstract = {The effect of four substrata (concrete, plywood, fibreglass and aluminium) on the recruitment of species and development of an intertidal estuarine fouling assemblage was examined in Quibray Bay of Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Many species, including the oyster Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale \& Roughley) and the barnacles Hexaminius sp., Balanus amphitrite Darwin and Balanus variegatus Darwin, recruited in greater numbers on concrete or plywood surfaces than on fibreglass or aluminium. As a result, patterns of change in the number of species through time were dependent on the substratum. Multivariate analyses indicated that assemblages on different substrata were significantly different after 1 or 2 months of submersion, but became more similar after longer periods (up to 4-5 months). The reasons for this gradual conformity varied depending on the season of submersion and the composition of the species settling in a particular season. The results of this study indicated that the nature of the substratum can affect both initial colonisation of particular species and the development of the assemblage over time. Because the effect of substratum varies with the period of submersion, comparisons of various studies on fouling assemblages using different natural and artificial substrata and for varying lengths of time are likely to be very difficult.},

As a result, there has been heightened concern about potential accumulation of marine debris and its consequent eﬀects on sanctuary resources. Field surveys were conducted at {GRNMS} in 2004 and 2005 to provide a spatially comprehensive characterization of benthic communities and to quantify the distribution and abundance of marine debris in relation to bottom features. The spatial distribution of debris was concentrated in the center of the sanctuary and was most frequently associated with ledges rather than other bottom types. On ledges, the presence and abundance of debris was signiﬁcantly related to observed boating activity and physiographic features including ledge height, ledge area, and percent cover of benthic organisms. The results from this study will aid managers in optimizing cleanup eﬀorts and long-term monitoring of debris accumulation patterns at {GRNMS} and other hard bottom areas in the {SAB}.},

Faunal composition was primarily related to substrate composition, distance from open ocean and depth (water masses) by using Detrended Correspondence Analysis. Six different biotopes were observed at depths between 100 and 400 m: (1) Lophelia reef, (2) sponge garden, (3) seapen communities, (4) soft bottom coral garden, (5) hard bottom coral garden and (6) cerianthid stands. Three Lophelia reefs were observed between 140 and 230 m depth in the outer part of the fjord. Geodia spp. and other large sponges were abundant on morainic bottom, on sills. Seapen communities occurred on muddy bottoms mainly between 250 and 350 m depth. The soft bottom coral garden comprised the gorgonian Isidella lofotensis, locally with densities up to 167 colonies/100 m2. Hard bottom coral gardens with Paragorgia arborea and Paramuricea placomus had a much lower density with a maximum of 33 colonies/100 m2. Litter and lost fishing gear were observed on 49\% of the locations. Lophelia and sponges were covered with silt to a much higher degree than previously observed offshore. Whether this is caused by naturally higher particle flux in fjords or is due to an increased input from anthropogenic sources cannot be concluded from the present study. In general, anthropogenic activities have lead to increased particle flux in fjords and a demand for monitoring sensitive deep-water habitats to detect related trends of declining biodiversity.},

Using higher size classes as proxy for litter distribution, this study gave a synoptic estimation of the amount, composition, and distribution of ﬂoating macro-litter in the Mediterranean. The average amount of macro-litter was in a range of 2–5 items/km2, with the highest in the Adriatic basin. Seasonal patterns were present in almost all study areas and were signiﬁcant in the Ligurian Sea, Sardinian-Balearic basin, and Central Tyrrhenian Sea. Plastic accounted for {\textgreater} 80\% of litter in all areas and seasons, with the highest proportion in the Adriatic Sea, Ligurian Sea, and Sicilian-Sardinian Channels; in the Bonifacio Strait, Tyrrhenian Sea, and Sardinian-Balearic basin, litter composition was instead more diverse. Spatial analysis suggested an almost homogeneous distribution of litter without evident regular aggregation zones.},

	abstract = {Ghost ﬁshing is the capacity of lost traps to continue to catch and kill animals. In the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) ﬁshery in Florida, the effects of ghost ﬁshing are of particular concern, given the estimated 10s of 1000s of traps lost annually. We distributed 40 each of the three types of lobster traps (wire, wood – wire hybrid, and wood slat) at three locations in the Florida Keys to simulate ghost ﬁshing. Divers monitored these traps biweekly for 1 year then monthly for two additional years, recording the time ghost traps remained intact and continued to ﬁsh, as well as the number of live and dead lobsters and other animals in each trap. Wood slat and hybrid traps remained intact and ﬁshed for 509 + 97 (median + median absolute deviation) and 480 + 142 d, respectively. Wire traps ﬁshed signiﬁcantly longer (779.5 + 273.5 d, p , 0.001), and several ﬁshed until the end of the experiment (1071 d). Traps in Florida Bay ﬁshed longer (711.5 + 51.5 d) than traps inshore (509 + 94.5 d) and offshore (381 + 171 days; p , 0.001) in the Atlantic Ocean. More lobsters were observed in hybrid traps (mean ¼ 4.81 + 0.03 s.e.) than in wood slat (3.85 + 0.16) or wire traps (3.17 + 0.03; F ¼ 40.15, d.f. ¼ 2, p , 0.001). Wire traps accounted for 83\% of ﬁsh conﬁned overall and 74\% of the dead ﬁsh observed in traps. Ghost traps in Florida Bay and Atlantic inshore killed 6.8 + 1.0 and 6.3 + 0.88 lobsters per trap annually, while Atlantic offshore traps killed fewer (3.0 + 0.69) lobsters, likely as a result of lower lobster abundance in traps. The combined effects of greater lobster mortality and greater abundance of lost traps in inshore areas account for the majority of the estimated 637 622 + 74 367 (mean + s.d.) lobsters that die in ghost traps annually.},

Totally, 637.62 g (42.5 mg/m2) of fishing lines were collected. We sampled 120 items entangled belongings to 7 animal taxa (density 6.49 items/100 m of fishing lines). We also observed a not quantifiable number of egagropiles (Posidonia oceanica spheroids), Rhodophyceae (Halymenia sp.) and segments of reeds of Phragmites communis, trapped in the fishing lines. Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopy was used in order to identify the chemical composition of the fishing lines: 92\% was made of nylon while 8.0\% was determined as fluorocarbon based polymers (polyvinylidene fluoride). Because of their subtlety and reduced size, sandy beach cleaning operations should include at least two consecutive removal samplings: indeed, a part of this litter (12.14\%) is not removed in the first sampling. The unexpected high density of fishing lines suggests specific management actions aimed to periodically remove this neglected anthropogenic litter.},

Approximately, 93\% of all debris items were plastic with plastic fragments (≤2.5 cm) being the most common. There were spatial differences (p ≤ 0.0001) in plastic debris abundance between coastal exposures. Atlantic Ocean beaches had larger quantities of plastic debris by weight and by meter (m) of shoreline. Stranded plastic may be associated with Atlantic Ocean currents associated with leakage from the North Atlantic sub-tropical gyre.},

These indices from experimentally weathered particles were compared to microplastic particles collected from oceanic surface waters in the California Current, the North Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre, and the transition region between the two, in order to estimate the exposure time of the oceanic plastics. Although chemical bonds exhibited some nonlinear changes with environmental exposure, they can potentially approximate the weathering time of some plastics, especially high-density polyethylene. The majority of the North Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre polyethylene particles we measured have inferred exposure times N 18 months, with some N 30 months. Inferred particle weathering times are consistent with ocean circulation models suggesting a long residence time in the open ocean.},

Sixty-seven percent of the litter was entangled or colonised by invertebrates such as sponges (41\%) or sea anemones (15\%).

	abstract = {This research aimed to evaluate anthropogenic litter found on beaches with different levels of development and use along the coast of Pernambuco (northeast Brazil) to determine patterns in composition and origin. The study was conducted in January 2013 at nine beaches classiﬁed into three groups according to the level of urbanization. At each beach, three sections measuring 100 m long and 1 m wide were deﬁned along the high-tide waterline where all items of anthropogenic litter larger than 2 cm were visually counted and classiﬁed. The sections were separated by intervals of 100 m. Within each 100 m section, random stretches of 10 m were selected where all the visible plastic fragments with sizes between 0.5 and 2 cm were collected and bagged for subsequent counting. Sources of anthropogenic litter were divided into three categories, namely beach users, land-based (houses/residences), mixed, and ﬁsheries. A total of 12,815 items were found on the nine beaches within the three transects on each beach (one survey per beach), with densities (items/m2) of 2.3, 5.7, and 6.3 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The most-represented items of anthropogenic litter in the evaluated samples were plastic, food scraps, and wood (wooden skewers). With respect to items composed of plastic, the majority were cigarette butts (45\%). Additionally, cigarette butts made up 26\% of all anthropogenic litter samples collected. A larger amount of fragments smaller than 2 cm occurred in all beaches; for this size fraction, the densities were 0.6, 0.5, and 0.76 items/m2 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, which were 1.5, 2.5, and 1.65 times higher, respectively, compared to those of fragments larger than 2 cm.The beaches with lower levels of urbanization also had smaller quantities of anthropogenic litter. Items related to beach users were predominant for most of the beaches. The conﬁrmation that beach users are primarily responsible for the generation of anthropogenic litter may contribute to the development of strategies to reduce the problem, such as installing bins and distribution containers for anthropogenic litter collection and designing educational campaigns for beach users.},

A signiﬁcant fraction of this leakage originates from coastal cities, particularly during extreme rainfall events. As coastal cities continue to grow, ﬁnding ways to reduce this macroplastic leakage is extremely pertinent. Here, we explore why and how coastal cities can reduce macroplastic leakages during extreme rainfall events. Using nine global cities as a basis, we establish that while cities actively create policies that reduce plastic leakages, more needs to be done. Nonetheless, these policies are economically, socially and environmentally cobeneﬁcial to the city environment. While the lack of political engagement and economic concerns limit these policies, lacking social motivation and engagement is the largest limitation towards implementing policy. We recommend cities to incentivize citizen and municipal engagement with responsible usage of plastics, cleaning the environment and preparing for future extreme rainfall events.},

	abstract = {Litter presence was assessed on the entire Cuban coastline, and includes 99 beaches from all Cuban regions, during ﬁeld work carried out in 2012 and 2015. A standard method veriﬁed in several countries was applied, which classiﬁed beaches for nine types of litter into four grades (A-excellent to D-poor). Almost half of the Cuban beaches obtained excellent cleanliness scores, although many needed to be better managed. In this baseline, the most common types of residue were general litter (8\% grade D and 35\% grades B/C) and potentially harmful litter (b 68\% with grade A). Resort beaches and those with international visitors showed the best litter management. Tourism Impacts seems to be related to visitor origin therefore choices to develop sustainable tourism in rural and village beaches (64\%) appears low, if beach cleaning gross investment is focused on resort beaches (24\%). Finally, this paper highlights geographical distribution and types of litter patterns.},

	abstract = {In situ studies of plastic deterioration can help us understand the longevity of macroplastic as well as the generation of microplastics in the environment. Photo-oxidation contributing to the generation of microplastics in the marine environment was explored using four types of plastic (polyethene, polystyrene, poly(ethylene terephthalate) and Biothene® exposed in light and in shade, in both air and sea water. Metrics for deterioration were tensile extensibility and oxidation rate. Measurements were conducted at intervals between 7 and 600 days' exposure. Deterioration was faster in air than in sea water and was further accelerated in direct light compared to shade. Extensibility and oxidation were signiﬁcantly inversely correlated in samples exposed in air. Samples in sea water lost extensibility at a slower rate. Polystyrene, which enters the waste stream rapidly due to its wide application in packaging, deteriorated fastest and is, therefore, likely to form microplastics more rapidly than other materials, especially when exposed to high levels of irradiation, for example when stranded on the shore.},

	abstract = {Estimates of marine debris are often based on beach surveys. Few studies have documented the veracity of these observations and the factors that may aﬀect accuracy. Our laboratory-scale experiment identiﬁed potential sources of error associated with visual identiﬁcation of marine debris (1–2 cm long) during shoreline surveys of sand beaches. Characteristics of the survey site (beach characteristics), observer (personal characteristics), and debris (color and size) may be important factors to consider when analyzing data from shoreline surveys. The results of this study show that the ability of individuals to accurately identify plastic fragments depends on the plastic and sand color, and density of shell fragments. Most suggestively, the high accuracy of blue plastic counts (95\%) and the under-counting of white (50\%) and clear plastic counts (55\%) conﬁrmed the hypothesis that a signiﬁcant amount of clear and white plastic fragments may be missed during shoreline surveys. These results highlight the need for further research and possible modiﬁcations of visual shoreline survey methodologies in order to optimize this cost-eﬀective method of marine debris monitoring.},

	abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines.
            Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.},

	abstract = {The evolution of species of giant tortoises and the nature of processes governing their dispersal in the Western Indian Ocean have been matters of interest for some time. Historical records indicate that these animals were once widely distributed in the region, from Madagascar to the Seychelles in the north and to the Mascarene islands in the south. New data on the status of Aldabrachelys and related or supposed species, and controversies regarding genetic diversity and distribution have prompted an evaluation of the islands and submerged Banks in the region that, during the later Cenozoic, might have provided refuges and/or stepping-stones for the spread of populations in what is now open ocean. Given the apparent stability of the crust in much of the area for at least the Quaternary Period, sea-level, driven by climatic change, and transport by ocean currents, appear to be the principle factors controlling the access not only of populations of giant tortoises but also other terrestrial biota to potential refuge areas in the region. The distributions of living and fossil tortoise communities are discussed. Four types of terrestrial oceanic refuges for migrants have been identiﬁed. At the present day, with the exception of Aldabra, high limestone islands offer only relatively small areas for colonization and all would have been drowned during interglacial sea-level high-stands. Although they have the potential for some increases in land area during the early stages of transitions to low-stand, as sea-level fell signiﬁcantly they would have become waterless pinnacles, only generally accessible to organisms capable of ﬂight. Volcanic islands have the same general limitations, but may have remained as smaller entities when sea-level was higher than at present, but providing only limited land access and restricted vegetation. Low islands and sand cays, typically of more recent origin, could not have existed during periods of high sea-levels, but many are situated on extensive submerged Banks that would have formed relatively large land areas when sea-level was low. Major Banks, most of which are regarded as fragments of continental crust, are currently submerged but, during glacial periods would together have offered land areas in excess of 130,000 km2, providing a diverse range of terrestrial environments and vegetation. Access to all of these was nevertheless restricted by the distribution of ocean currents, the only plausible natural means of dispersal, which probably varied during glacial interludes, but also by the abilities of the animals to survive long periods adrift in the ocean. The distribution of these tortoises, in both the fossil record and historical data, provides a model for the dispersal of other terrestrial biota in the region, although the present distribution and genetic characteristics of the tortoises probably reﬂects recent human intervention.},

In the context of an outreach project, volunteers (\$1500 high-school students) participated in a nation-wide survey of {AMD} on 43 beaches distributed randomly along the entire Chilean coast (18°S to 53°S). The mean density of {AMD} was 1.8 items {mÀ}2 and the major types were plastics, cigarette butts and glass. Densities in central Chile were lower than in northern and southern Chile, which could be due to different attitudes of beach users or to intense beach cleaning in central regions.

Regular cleaning of selected islets will take care of most of the accumulated debris and may improve the ecology and tourism potential. However, arrangements and logistics require more study.},

This series of studies investigated the deterioration of carrier bags made with Mater-Bi ({MB}), a starch-based bioplastic, in soil, compost and two aquatic ecosystems, a littoral marsh and seawater. Results from the laboratory study indicated that bioplastic carrier bags were rapidly deteriorated in soil and compost. After three months of incubation, weight loss of specimens was of 37\% and 43\% in soil and compost, respectively. Conversely, little deterioration was observed in specimens buried in soil under ﬁeld conditions or exposed to water of a littoral marsh and of the Adriatic Sea. These ﬁndings were consistent with the greater number of bacteria and especially fungi capable of degrading {MB} that were recovered from soil and compost with respect to the two aquatic ecosystems. Considering that a variety of microbial isolates are capable of using {MB} as a source of carbon, a new alternative to recycle these {MB}-based carrier bags was explored. More speciﬁcally, starchy residues from bags were fermented by the fungus Rhizopus oryzae to produce up to 35 mg of lactic acid per g of bag residues.},

Plots of reef 1.0–1.3 km2 at three Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were initially cleaned of derelict ﬁshing gear in 1999 then resurveyed in 2000 and 2001. Submerged debris densities across sites ranged from 16 to 165 debris items/km2. Resurveyed sites yielded annual marine debris accumulation rates from 0 to 141 debris items/km2. This large range was attributed to the physiography of reef areas surveyed. Trawl net webbing was signiﬁcantly more common than other types of debris recovered and represented 84\% of all debris encountered, suggesting that much of the debris originated from distant North Paciﬁc Ocean ﬁsheries. The likely source of most debris is the multinational trawl ﬁsheries of the North Paciﬁc Ocean. An international solution to this problem is needed. Targeted marine debris removal is a short-term, successful, entanglement mitigation strategy.},

	abstract = {Seagrass ecosystems are important in supporting marine biodiversity. However, the worldwide decline in seagrass areas due to anthropogenic factors leads to a decrease in the marine biodiversity they can support. There is growing awareness of the need for concepts to conserve and/or rehabilitate seagrass ecosystems. One option is to create artificial seagrass to provide a physical structure for the marine organisms to colonize. The objective of this research was to analyze the effect of some artificial seagrasses and seagrass transplants on marine biodiversity, with a focus on the macrozoobenthic community. The experimental design compared two types of artificial seagrass (polypropylene ribbons and shrub-shaped plastic leaves), and seagrass transplants from nearby seagrass meadows. The experimental plots were 4 x 4 m2 with 3 replicates. Macrozoobenthic communities were sampled fortnightly for 3.5 months. At the end of the experiment, makrozoobenthos were also sampled from a natural seagrass bed nearby. Of 116 macrozoobenthic species in the artificial seagrass plots, 91 were gastropods. The density of the macrobenthic fauna increased from the beginning to the end of the study in all treatments, but the increase was only significant for the artificial seagrass treatment (i.e. shrub-like plastic leaves). There was a distinct separation between the macrozoobenthic community structure found in the restoration plots (artificial seagrass and transplanted seagrass) compared to natural seagrass beds.},

Here, we present litter densities recorded during ship- and helicopter-based observer surveys in the Barents Sea and Fram Strait (Arctic). Thirty-one items were recorded in total, 23 from helicopter and eight from research vessel transects. Litter quantities ranged between 0 and 0.216 items km-1 with a mean of 0.001 (±{SEM} 0.005) items km-1. All of the ﬂoating objects observed were plastic items. Litter densities were slightly higher in the Fram Strait (0.006 items km-1) compared with the Barents Sea (0.004 items km-1). More litter was recorded during helicopter-based surveys than during ship-based surveys (0.006 and 0.004 items km-1, respectively). When comparing with the few available data with the same unit (items km-1 transect), the densities found herein are slightly higher than those from Antarctica but substantially lower than those from temperate waters. However, since anthropogenic activities in the Fram Strait are expanding because of sea ice shrinkage, and since currents from the North Atlantic carry a continuous supply of litter to the north, this problem is likely to worsen in years to come unless serious mitigating actions are taken to reduce the amounts of litter entering the oceans.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of epibiosis is fundamental to understanding the role of biological interactions in the functioning of marine ecosystems. At many coastal sites, barnacles are abundant as epibionts on the shells of mussels. As they approach the shore, cypris larvae explore the environment, actively seeking suitable settlement sites and rejecting unsuitable substrata. Suitability involves micro-features of the surface, including its texture and contours, chemical signals and the presence of conspeciﬁcs. To investigate whether epibiosis on mussel shells indicates a preference for this substratum on the part of the barnacle Chthamalus dentatus, artiﬁcial plates were deployed at two rocky shore sites on the south coast of South Africa. These plates offered settling cyprids four habitat choices: a live mussel, the shell of a recently dead mussel, a ﬁne resolution resin replica of a mussel shell to mimic architectural micro-surface, without the chemical characteristics of natural shells and a rock mimic, a surface covered in a ﬁlm of hard plastic that resembled natural rock surface as closely as possible. Settling surfaces were photographed monthly, and new barnacles were counted and allocated to size classes, so that survival could be estimated over a period of several months. Barnacles showed a clear preference for the rock mimic surfaces, which on average supported double the number of settlers found on mussel replicas. These in turn were signiﬁcantly higher than the numbers on live and dead mussel shell surfaces, implying that there are features of both dead and live mussel shells that deter barnacle settlement. In contrast, ﬁnal abundances of adults showed no signiﬁcant effect of settling surface. The results suggest that during settlement, cyprids avoid chemical cues from mussel shells that persist even after the death of the mussel. This suggests that the high numbers of barnacles often found on the surface of live mussels could be due to saturation of substratum.},

Samples were retrieved every month and the extent of biofouling and biodegradation were monitored. Biofouling was found to depend not only on the season but also on the chemical nature of the polymer. Surface energy of all the four polymers is positively correlated with fouling only at the initial stages (three months) while surface roughness had a negative correlation. The later increased during the study period. Total suspended solids and organic matter were more abundant on {HDPE}, followed by {PP} and {LDPE}, indicating that among polyoleﬁns hydrophobic surfaces (lower surface energy) favor biofouling over one year. Maximum fouling was observed on polycarbonate during initial three months. Chlorophyll a showed a decreasing trend during the study, as secondary foulers such as Balanus amphitrite, were dominant after the monsoon (6th month in the present study). Maximum weight loss was seen in {LDPE} (1.9\%), followed by that in {HDPE} (1.6\%), {PC} (0.69\%) and ﬁnally in {PP} (0.65\%) samples in the 12 months time period. {FTIR} spectra of {PC} displayed a decrease in carbonate carbonyl index, while an initial increase and a decrease in carbonyl index of polyoleﬁns as a function of time indicated biodegradation.},

This study examined whether the inﬂuence of storms may be more pronounced in sheltered coastal waters compared to more exposed coastlines where biota could have adaptations to persist in larger swell conditions. There were obvious regional differences for wrack species richness, abundances and assemblages that matched the attached ﬂoral subtidal landscape in each region. Consequently, invertebrates also differed amongst regions, which highlight the close afﬁnity that some invertebrates have with drifting macrophytes. Fish were not so closely aligned to the regional patterns identiﬁed for wrack or invertebrates suggesting that many ﬁsh are using wrack accumulations as habitat but, being highly mobile, they may actively and constantly move into, out of and within these habitat features. Well-known beach-type models focused upon beach morphology may be more pertinent to the ecology of the surf zones offshore than previously thought, being the most consistent indicator of wrack accumulations and their fauna. This new evidence on the ecology of nearshore waters during storm versus calm weather in multiple regions and the subsequent inﬂuence on wrack–fauna associations in sandy-beach surf zones are important for future beach management, particularly when and where large wrack accumulations occur.},

Origin was argued for in the region of southern India or Australia/New Zealand where congeners occur, or the Mediterranean from whence the species was ﬁrst described. Primary dispersal by ocean rafting was assumed, but synonymy of 20 names under P. litoralis and absence of geographic variability imply recent and consistent global recruitment and/or remarkably conservative morphology. Perhaps the synonymy is too broad or, a converse view, especially when Pontodrilus is placed under Megascolecidae sensu Blakemore, 2000 rather than Acanthodrilidae, is of an ancient species with precursors close to the original forms of this family, living in a relatively constant and stable littoral habitat. The current review is based on new records from recent ecological survey and taxonomic analysis of Pontodrilus and related genera for which the restoration of Pontodril-inae/-idae Vejdovsky, 1884 may be merited. An argument is presented for a dual mechanism of dispersal of P. litoralis, involving both historical human transportation (via ship’ sand-ballast) and natural rafting (of euryhaline cocoons on ﬂotsam).

In coastal Paraná, many factors including shipping, aquaculture and the use of artificial substrates provide suitable environments for the establishment and rapid spread of introduced marine species. To better understand this process, the encrusting community was studied on polyethylene plates (n = 120, 10 x 10 cm) that were placed seasonally at fixed locations on the inner continental shelf to detect non-native species. Of the 62 taxa found, 40 were identified to species, 14 of which were native, 9 introduced and 17 cryptogenic. We found a new introduction while most introduced species were previously reported at a nearby estuary with an international port. Possible complementary explanations for these detections are 1) estuaries influence ecological processes on the inner continental shelf, 2) the study area is near the route of cargo and other ships entering the port, 3) other local vectors, such as hulls of fishing and recreational boats, and artificial reefs link the estuary to the offshore areas. Thus, not only are estuaries invaded by exotic species, but also non-indigenous marine species may be present in the open sea where they are likely to colonize artificial substrates.},

Hitherto, assessing the relative contribution of pollution sources through beach surveys is methodologically challenging. We surveyed ten beaches along the leeward and windward coastlines of Aruba (southern Caribbean) to determine differences in macro- and meso-debris densities. Differences were quantiﬁed using three metrics: 1) the gradient in macro-debris density away from the waterfront; 2) the proportion of plastic within macro-debris; 3) the meso-:macro-debris ratio. Overall 42,585 macro-debris items and 884 meso-debris items were collected. The density of near-shore macro-debris, proportion of plastic debris herein, and meso-:macro-debris ratio were highest on the windward coastline. These results suggest that southern Caribbean windward coastlines are mainly exposed to debris originating from distal marine-based sources, and leeward coastlines to local land-based sources. Our metrics clearly reﬂect these differences, providing novel means to survey debris source origin.},

This pattern was present despite blue fragments being smaller and lighter. The plastic debris of lowest frequency were the larger and heavier pieces (red). To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst record of plastic in Sooty Tern nests. Trindade Island is on an oceanic zone expected to accumulate garbage due to the dynamic ocean currents. Such ﬁndings call for a closer inspection of pollution in the Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {Bacterial colonization of marine plastic litter ({MPL}) is known for over four decades. Still, only a few studies on the plastic colonization process and its inﬂuencing factors are reported. In this study, seaﬂoor {MPL} was sampled at diﬀerent locations across the Belgian part of the North Sea to study bacterial community structure using 16S metabarcoding. These marine plastic bacterial communities were compared with those of sediment and seawater, and resin pellets sampled on the beach, to investigate the origin and uniqueness of plastic bacterial communities. Plastics display great variation of bacterial community composition, while each showed signiﬁcant diﬀerences from those of sediment and seawater, indicating that plastics represent a distinct environmental niche. Various environmental factors correlate with the diversity of {MPL} bacterial composition across plastics. In addition, intrinsic plastic-related factors such as pigment content may contribute to the diﬀerences in bacterial colonization. Furthermore, the diﬀerential abundance of known primary and secondary colonizers across the various plastics may indicate diﬀerent stages of bacterial colonization, and may confound comparisons of free-ﬂoating plastics. Our studies provide insights in the factors that shape plastic bacterial colonization and shed light on the possible role of plastic as transport vehicle for bacteria through the aquatic environment.},

In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during longterm exposure on the seaﬂoor, both at a harbor and an oﬀshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during bioﬁlm formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identiﬁed a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of bioﬁlm formation. Additionally, by implementing {ITS}2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identiﬁed and characterized for the ﬁrst time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to oﬀshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage bioﬁlm, suggesting that bioﬁlm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates.},

Faunal data are combined with {GEOSECS} geochemical data to investigate any relationship between benthic foraminifera (assemblages and species) and deep-sea properties. In general, benthic foraminifera show a good correlation to surface productivity, organic carbon ﬂux to the sea ﬂoor, deep-sea oxygenation and, to a lesser extent, to bottom temperature, without correlation with the water depths. The foraminiferal census data combined with geochemical data has enabled the division of the Indian Ocean into two faunal provinces. Province A occupies the northwestern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea region) where surface primary production has a major maximum during the summer monsoon season and a secondary maximum during winter monsoon season that leads to high organic ﬂux to the seaﬂoor, making the deep-sea one of the most oxygen-deﬁcient regions in the world ocean, with a pronounced oxygen minimum zone ({OMZ}). This province is dominated by benthic foraminifera characteristic of low oxygen and high organic food ﬂux including Uvigerina peregrina, Robulus nicobarensis, Bolivinita pseudopunctata, Bolivinita sp., Bulimina aculeata, Bulimina alazanensis, Ehrenbergina carinata and Cassidulina carinata. Province B covers southern, southeastern and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean and is dominated by Nuttallides umbonifera, Epistominella exigua, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Uvigerina proboscidea, Cibicides wuellerstorﬁ, Cassidulina laevigata, Pullenia bulloides, Pullenia osloensis, Pyrgo murrhina, Oridorsalis umbonatus, Gyroidinoides (=Gyroidina) soldanii and Gyroidinoides cf. gemma suggesting well-oxygenated, cold deep water with low (oligotrophic) and pulsed food supply.},

          , 
            The ubiquity of plastics in oceans worldwide raises concerns about their ecological implications. Suspended microplastics ({\textless}5 mm) can be ingested by a wide range of marine organisms and may accumulate up the food web along with associated chemicals. Additionally, plastics provide a stable substrate to a wide range of organisms and, owing to their widespread dispersal, may function as vectors for harmful and invasive species. Despite the growing application of molecular techniques to study ocean microplastic colonizers, to date there is no comparative study on {DNA} extraction methods for ocean plastic biofilms. The present study aims to fill this gap by comparing {DNA} yield, amplification efficiency, costs and processing time of different {DNA} extraction techniques applied to oceanic microplastics. {DNA} was extracted with five methods (four extraction kits, and standard phenol:chloroform purification) using two mechanical lysis techniques (bead beating and cryogenic grinding with liquid nitrogen) applied to three plastic quantities (1, 15, and 50 fragments per extraction) and size classes (0.05–0.15 and 0.15–0.5 mm). All methods resulted in {DNA} suitable for downstream applications and were successfully amplified. Overall, the Qiagen Puregene Tissue kit yielded relatively high {DNA} concentrations for most sizes and amounts of plastics at relatively low costs and short processing time. This study provides a detailed evaluation of {DNA} extraction methods from ocean plastics, and may assist future research using molecular techniques to study ocean plastic biofilms.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Speciﬁcally, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the signiﬁcance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Suppose we are given collection P of semi-labeled trees over various subsets of a set of taxa. The ancestral compatibility problem asks whether there is a semi-labeled tree that respects the clusterings and the ancestor/descendant relationships implied by the trees in P. The running time and space usage of the best previous algorithm for testing ancestral compatibility depend on the degrees of the nodes in the trees in P.
Results:  We give a algorithm for the ancestral compatibility problem that runs in O({MP} log2 {MP} ) time and uses O({MP} ) space, where {MP} is the total number of nodes and edges in the trees in P.
Conclusions:  Taxonomies enable researchers to expand greatly the taxonomic coverage of their phylogenetic analy‑ses. The running time of our method does not depend on the degrees of the nodes in the trees in P. This characteris‑tic is important when taxonomies—which can have nodes of high degree—are used.},

Samples were also aged at sea in Lorient harbour in order to compare laboratory and natural degradation mechanisms and kinetics. Due to its morphology, hydrolysis of {PHBV} in natural seawater is quite slow, and samples were observed to undergo preferentially an enzymatic surface degradation. Increasing the aging temperature in the laboratory promotes the water uptake and causes hydrolysis. As two degradation mechanisms occur in parallel, the choice of test conditions is critical, and the lifetime of {PHBV} in a marine environment is difﬁcult to predict accurately. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The presence of marine debris has been reported recently in several oceans basins; there is very little information available for Mexican Paciﬁc coasts, however. This research examined the composition, possible sources, distribution, and density of Floating Marine Debris ({FMD}) during nine research surveys conducted during 2010–2012 in the Mexican Central Paciﬁc ({MCP}). Of 1820 ﬂoating objects recorded, 80\% were plastic items. Sources of {FMD} were determined using key objects, which indicated that the most were related to the presence of the industrial harbor and of a growing ﬁshing industry in the study area. Densities were relatively high, ranging from 40 to 2440 objects/km2; the highest densities were recorded in autumn. {FMD} were distributed near coastal regions, mainly in Jalisco, inﬂuenced by river outﬂow and surface currents. Our results seem to follow worldwide trends and highlight the need for further studies on potential ecological impacts within coastal waters of the {MCP}. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Between 2005 and 2007, we investigated the taxonomic group and wet weight of sessile multicellular eukaryonts growing on 33 B-type dart tags recaptured from raggedtooth sharks (Carcharias taurus Rafinesque, 1810) along the eastern coast of South Africa. All tags, except one from a shark that had been at liberty only for 13 days, contained some degree of macro-fouling that ranged from 0.031 to 7.687 g wet weight. Barnacles and hydroids were the first colonisers and were recorded on tags after only 47 days. Bivalves, polychaetes and algae succeeded within 60 days. The last two taxa to be recorded were ascidians and sponges. There was no significant relationship between either the biomass of sessile organisms (P ¼ 0.17) or the number of taxa (P ¼ 0.59) found growing on tags and their time at liberty. Calcium carbonate plugs, ranging in weight from 0.16 to 9.18 g, were found at the site of the tag insertion wound on 27.3\% of recaptures. The present study highlights the extent of biofouling growth on tags and its potential to bias results from tagging studies.},

Their fragmentation leads to a continuum of debris sizes (meso to microplastics) entrapped in gyres and colonized by microorganisms. In the present work, the structure of eukaryotes, bacteria and Archaea was studied by a metabarcoding approach, and statistical analysis associated with network building was used to deﬁne a core microbiome at the plastic surface. Most of the bacteria signiﬁcantly associated with the plastic waste originated from non-marine ecosystems, and numerous species can be considered as hitchhikers, whereas others act as keystone species (e.g., Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales, Streptomycetales and Cyanobacteria) in the bioﬁlm. The chemical analysis provides evidence for a speciﬁc colonization of the polymers. Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria signiﬁcantly dominated mesoplastics consisting of poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polystyrene. Polyethylene was also dominated by these bacterial classes and Actinobacteria. Microplastics were made of polyethylene but differed in their crystallinity, and the majorities were colonized by Betaproteobacteria. Our study indicated that the bacteria inhabiting plastics harboured distinct metabolisms from those present in the surrounding water. For instance, the metabolic pathway involved in xenobiotic degradation was overrepresented on the plastic surface.},

	abstract = {Background: Few studies have reported the species composition of bacterial communities in marine biofilms formed on natural or on man-made existing structures. In particular, the roles and surface specificities of primary colonizers are largely unknown for most surface types. The aim of this study was to obtain potentially pioneering bacterial strains with high forming-biofilm abilities from two kinds of marine biofilms, collected from two different surfaces of the French Atlantic coast: an intertidal mudflat which plays a central role in aquaculture and a carbon steel structure of a harbour, where biofilms may cause important damages.
Results: A collection of 156 marine heterotrophic aerobic bacteria isolated from both biofilms was screened for their ability to form biofilms on polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates. Out of 25 strains able to build a biofilm in these conditions, only four bacteria also formed a thick and stable biofilm on glass surfaces under dynamic conditions. These strains developed biofilms with four different three - dimensional architectures when observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy: Flavobacterium sp. {II}2003 biofilms harboured mushroom-like structures, Roseobacter sp. {IV}3009 biofilms were quite homogeneous, Shewanella sp. {IV}3014 displayed hairy biofilms with horizontal fibres, whereas Roseovarius sp. {VA}014 developed heterogeneous and tousled biofilms.
Conclusions: This work led for the first time to the obtaining of four marine bacterial strains, potentially pioneering bacteria in marine biofilms, able to adhere to at least two different surfaces (polystyrene and glass) and to build specific 3D biofilms. The four selected strains are appropriate models for a better understanding of the colonization of a surface as well as the interactions that can occur between bacteria in a marine biofilm, which are crucial events for the initiation of biofouling.},

The amount cleaned-up was only 1/7 of the total coastal driftwood. It was found that the amount of coastal driftwood is not only related to the amount of precipitation but is also related to the distance from the location of the landslide to the river mouth and to the landslide area. The amount of accumulated coastal driftwood demonstrated log-proﬁle declines with increasing distance to the river mouth. Nearshore current and wave motion are the critical factors for driftwood deposition. Much of the driftwood washed into the sea harmed the tourism and ﬁshing industries, endangered navigation and oceanic activities, and impacted the marine environment and ecosystem.},

Our study demonstrates the prevalence of plastic debris as a world-wide marine contaminant. Characteristics of the debris suggest it originated primarily from land-based sources. To determine their potential geographic sources we used the Surface Current from Diagnostic model of near-surface ocean currents, forced by satellite sea level and wind data. While preliminary evidence indicated the Southeast Asia to be the main source of the ﬂotsam, the model highlighted Somalia as another potential primary source.

	abstract = {This paper reports the impact of pollution on marine ecosystem; it analyses the factors responsible for degradation and suggests suitable corrective measures. Around the world, marine ecosystems are being threatened, degraded, damaged or destroyed by human activities, one of which is pollution The rapid population growth and enormous urban and coastal development in many of the world's coastal regions have caused considerable concern that anthropogenic pollution may reduce biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems, resulting in reduction and depletion of human marine food resources. In addition, pollution reduces the aesthetic value and also the intrinsic value of the marine environment, whether the pollution is visual (such as oil pollution and plastic debris) or invisible (such as chemical compounds). The recent pictures coming out of the oil spills off the Gulf of Mexico in the United States and also the container tanker collision off the Mumbai coast are vivid examples. Another main reason for concern about marine pollution is related to the direct effects of pollution on human health. Because many pollutants accumulate in marine organisms, humans are exposed to pollutants when they consume food from polluted areas. Marine pollution occurs when unsustainable elements gain entry to water masses, potentially causing spread of invasive organisms, diseases and can turn water quality potentially toxic. Most sources of marine pollution are land based, such as wind blown debris, industrial / domestic pollutants discharged and potential spillovers from freight/ bulk ocean carriers. When toxins are concentrated upward within the ocean food chain, many elements combine in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic. As these materials are incorporated into the marine eco system, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these cause mutations, as well as diseases, this can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Globalization has brought in its wake increased demand on scarce resources leading to rapid depletion of a wide range of non degradable products viz., metals, plastics, rubber products, which in turn generate huge amounts of solid wastes causing pollution at the entry of marine waters. Besides the coastal regions of India are characterized by slums, with poor sanitation facilities aggravating the problem. Suggestions are offered, both invasive and non invasive which can definitely reduce the burden placed on our valuable resources which may soon vanish unless the counter measures are implemented effectively.},

We combined measurements of physical surface properties of polymers (hydrophobicity and roughness) with microbiological characterization of the bioﬁlm (cell counts, taxonomic composition, and heterotrophic activity) using a wide range of techniques, with some of them used for the ﬁrst time on plastics. Our experimental setup using aquariums with natural circulating seawater during 6 weeks allowed us to characterize the successive phases of primo-colonization, growing, and maturation of the bioﬁlms. We highlighted different trends between polymer types with distinct surface properties and composition, the biodegradable {AA}-{OXO} and {PHBV} presenting higher colonization by active and speciﬁc bacteria compared to non-biodegradable polymers ({PE} and {OXO}). Succession of bacterial population occurred during the three colonization phases, with hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria being highly abundant on all plastic types.

Obelia griffini Calkins, 1899, the most frequently encountered species, was collected on three of the four derelict substrates. Eight of the species are known to be amphi-Pacific in distribution. Of the rest, at least five (S tylactaria s p . ; Eutima japonica Uchida, 1925; Orthopyxis platycarpa Bale, 1914; Sertularella sp.; Plumularia sp.) are not previously known from the west coast of North America. Hydroids of E. japonica occurred as commensals in the mantle cavity of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819. Obelia griffini, O. gracilis Calkins, 1899 (not its secondary homonym Laomedea gracilis Dana, 1846) and O. surcularis Calkins, 1899 are taken to be conspecific. Of the three simultaneous synonyms, precedence is assigned to the name O. griffini under the Principle of the First Reviser in zoological nomenclature. The species is sometimes regarded as identical with O. dichotoma (Linnaeus, 1758).},

	abstract = {Plastic debris has been documented in many marine ecosystems, including remote coastlines, the water column, the deep sea, and subtropical gyres. The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre ({NPSG}), colloquially called the ‘‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch,’’ has been an area of particular scientific and public concern. However, quantitative assessments of the extent and variability of plastic in the {NPSG} have been limited. Here, we quantify the distribution, abundance, and size of plastic in a subset of the eastern Pacific (approximately 20–40uN, 120–155uW) over multiple spatial scales. Samples were collected in Summer 2009 using surface and subsurface plankton net tows and quantitative visual observations, and Fall 2010 using surface net tows only. We documented widespread, though spatially variable, plastic pollution in this portion of the {NPSG} and adjacent waters. The overall median microplastic numerical concentration in Summer 2009 was 0.448 particles m22 and in Fall 2010 was 0.021 particles m22, but plastic concentrations were highly variable over the submesoscale (10 s of km). Size-frequency spectra were skewed towards small particles, with the most abundant particles having a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.01 cm2. Most microplastic was found on the sea surface, with the highest densities detected in low-wind conditions. The numerical majority of objects were small particles collected with nets, but the majority of debris surface area was found in large objects assessed visually. Our ability to detect high-plastic areas varied with methodology, as stations with substantial microplastic did not necessarily also contain large visually observable objects. A power analysis of our data suggests that high variability of surface microplastic will make future changes in abundance difficult to detect without substantial sampling effort. Our findings suggest that assessment and monitoring of oceanic plastic debris must account for high spatial variability, particularly in regards to the evaluation of initiatives designed to reduce marine debris.},

Plastic (speciﬁcally plastic rope) was the dominant {AMD} present on beaches. The most common biofouling taxa were hydroids, bryozoans, algae and polychaetes, with one {NIMS} pest species, Sabella spallanzanii, detected fouling plastic rope. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that aquaculture is an {AMD} (plastic rope) generating activity that creates biosecurity risk by enhancing the spread of {NIMS}.

While the impact of marine debris and beach litter on marine and coastal fauna and ﬂora is a widely reported global issue, we investigate the impact on human health in New Zealand. Anthropogenic beach litter is ubiquitous, few beaches remain pristine, which consequently inﬂuences tourist choices and potentially negatively interacts with humans. Human impacts are not well-investigated, with no quantitative studies of impact but many studies qualitatively inferring impact. New Zealand has a socialised medical system allowing a quantitative, decadal assessment of medical insurance claims to determine patterns and trends across ecosystems and causes. We demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that anthropogenic beach litter poses a common and pervasive exposure hazard to all ages, with speciﬁc risk posed to young children. The New Zealand system allows these hazards to be investigated to determine the true effects and costs across a nation, providing an evidence base for decision-makers to address this ubiquitous environmental issue.},

	abstract = {Visual ship transect surveys provide crucial information about the density, and spatial distribution of ﬂoating anthropogenic litter in a basin. However, such observations provide a ‘snapshot’ of local conditions at a given time and cannot be used to deduce the provenance of the litter or to predict its fate, crucial information for management and mitigation policies. Particle tracking techniques have seen extensive use in these roles, however, most previous studies have used simplistic initial conditions based on bulk average inputs of debris to the system. Here, observations of ﬂoating anthropogenic macro debris in the Adriatic Sea are used to deﬁne initial conditions (number of particles, location, and time) in a Lagrangian particle tracking model. Particles are advected backward and forward in time for 60 days (120 days total) using surface velocities from an operational regional ocean model. Sources and sinks for debris observed in the central and southern Adriatic in May 2013 and March 2015 included the Italian coastline from Pescara to Brindisi, the Croatian island of Mljet, and the coastline from Dubrovnik through Montenegro to Albania. Debris observed in the northern Adriatic originated from the Istrian peninsula to the Italian city of Termoli, as well as the Croatian island of Cres and the Kornati archipelago. Particles spent a total of roughly 47 days aﬂoat. Coastal currents, notably the eastern and western Adriatic currents, resulted in large alongshore displacements. Our results indicate that anthropogenic macro debris originates largely from coastal sources near population centers and is advected by the cyclonic surface circulation until it strands on the southwest (Italian) coast, exits the Adriatic, or recirculates in the southern gyre.},

There have been or are at least 14 major routes of transoceanic dispersal of introduced species in the Pacific Ocean, here formally identified for the first time. Major receiver areas for introduced species are the Hawaiian Islands, the Pacific coast of North America, and Australasia; major donor areas are the Pacific coast of Asia, extending to southern Asia and the southwestern Pacific. The three major receiver areas identified here are predicted to harbor numerous undetected introduced species; in tum, these same regions are also those most likely to continue to receive new introductions.},

Biomarker ratios conﬁrmed that the oil had originated from the Macondo oil well and had undergone signiﬁcant weathering. Using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s records of the oil spill trajectory at the sea surface, we show that the honeycomb material preceded the front edge of the uncertainty of the oil slick trajectory by several kilometers.

Bacillus bacteria (mean 1664 ± 247 individuals {mmÀ}2) and pennate diatoms (1097 ± 154 {mmÀ}2) were most abundant, with coccoid bacteria, centric diatoms, dinoﬂagellates, coccolithophores, and radiolarians present. Bacterial abundance was patchy, but increased on foamed polystyrene. Diatom abundance increased on items with rough surfaces and at sites with high plastic concentrations. Morphotype richness increased slightly on larger fragments, and a biogeographic transition occurred between pennate diatom groups. Better characterizing this community will aid in understanding how it interacts with plastic pollution.},

	abstract = {Plastic debris carry fouling a variety of class-size organisms, among them harmful microorganisms that potentially play a role in the dispersal of allochthonous species and toxic compounds with ecological impacts on the marine environment and human health. We analyzed samples of marine plastics ﬂoating at the sea surface using a molecular {qPCR} assay to quantify the attached microalgal taxa, in particular, harmful species. Diatoms were the most abundant group of plastic colonizers with maximum abundance of 8.2 Â 104 cells {cmÀ}2 of plastics, the maximum abundance of dinoﬂagellates amounted to 1.1 Â 103 cells {cmÀ}2 of plastics. The most abundant harmful microalgal taxon was the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp., including at least 12 toxic species, and the dinoﬂagellate Ostreopsis cf. ovata with 6606 and 259 cells {cmÀ}2, respectively. The abundance of other harmful microalgal species including the toxic allochthonous dinoﬂagellate Alexandrium paciﬁcum ranged from 1 to 73 cells {cmÀ}2. In the present study, a direct relationship between the abundance of harmful algal species colonizing the plastic substrates and their toxin production was found. The levels of potential toxins on plastic samples ranged from 101 to 102 ng {cmÀ}2, considering the various toxin families produced by the colonized harmful microalgal species. We also measured the rate of adhesion by several target microalgal species. It ranged from 1.8 to 0.3 {dayÀ}1 demonstrating the capacity of plastic substrate colonizing rapidly by microalgae. The present study reports the ﬁrst estimates of molecular quantiﬁcation of microorganisms including toxin producing species that can colonize plastics. Such ﬁndings provide important insights for improving the monitoring practice of plastics and illustrate how the epi-plastic community can exacerbate the harmful effects of plastics by dispersal, acting as an alien and toxic species carrier and potentially being ingested through the marine trophic web.},

In this note we discuss the utility of introducing the acquisition of shelf-life and labels features from litter items into already established standardized protocols such as the one proposed by {MEDiterranean} International Trawl Survey ({MEDITS}). Our investigation was conducted on 612 high resolution images of litter items collected in each haul, which was retrieved during 6 years of surveys (2013–2018) around Sardinian sea (central western Mediterranean). While for the majority of items (89\%) expiration date or labels were not present or legible, over 50\% of dated items were likely dumped at sea from a period {\textless} 5 years. In this perspective, this sort of data could represent a useful tool for monitoring the eﬀectiveness of input reduction actions that implicitly rely on the gradual reduction of recently dumped items.},

The best settlement was observed on the {OSR} type when measured per metre (3450.00 Æ 125.83 ind {mÀ}1). Consequently, the ﬁndings showed that settlement preference of spat occurred according to rope structure, and if ropes are designed to combine numerous well-ﬁxed tassels, spat settlement can increase. Spat growth was affected by environmental factors and rope structure. In addition, the study revealed a negative relationship between density and growth.},

	abstract = {The distribution and composition of macro litter ﬂoating around oceanic islands is poorly known, especially in the North Atlantic. Due to its isolated location at the fringe of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, the Azores archipelago has recently been proposed as a potential retention zone for ﬂoating litter. To further investigate this assumption, opportunistic surveys from pole-and-line tuna ﬁshing boats were performed from 2015 to 2017 to document (1) the distribution and (2) the composition of the ﬂoating macro litter present oﬀ the Azores and Madeira islands. Among the 2406 visual transects, 482 ﬂoating debris were recorded and were mainly composed of general plastic user items (48\%), plastic packaging (21\%) and derelict ﬁshing gears (18\%). Average number of debris per transect was 0.19 ± 0.5, with a total number ranging between 0 and 5 items per transect. For the majority of transects (84\%), no debris was observed, 13\% of the transects contained a single item, and only 3\% contained more than one item. Although debris between 2.5 and 5 cm were recorded, 93\% of the debris were larger than 5 cm. The {GLMs} showed strong eﬀect of the observer (p {\textless} 0.001) and the standardized densities accounting for the observer bias were higher (1.39 ± 0.14 items.km-2) than the observed densities (0.78 ± 0.07 items.km−2). Debris densities were however relatively low and tended to aggregate around the Central group of the Azores (standardized mean: 0.90 ± 0.20 items.km−2). Our ﬁndings therefore suggest that most of the debris might originate from far away land-based sources and from ﬁshing activities. This study highlights the potential of ﬁsheries observer programs to obtain cost-eﬀective information on ﬂoating macro debris that are essential to support the implementation of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

	abstract = {In addition to producing extensive coastal infrastructure, urbanized estuaries are also often littered with large amounts of waste material. This can be used as habitat by fish and benthic plants and animals. Apart from studies of colonization of artificial reefs, which are usually deployed specifically to enhance populations of fish or to replace degraded habitat, there have been few studies that have specifically examined the use of waste material as habitat. Neither have previous studies compared different types of waste material that one characteristically finds in urbanized estuaries, nor the use of small patches of habitat typically created by waste. Spatial comparisons of species found on previously dumped artificial material may be confounded by the fact that different types of waste may be dumped in different places, or may be of different age. This study built small patch reefs of three different types of widespread waste material (tyres, wood or metal) and compared colonization of these over 19 months to colonization of patch reefs of similar age and size made from natural sandstone. Algal assemblages were similar among the different types of reefs, with all showing more cover and diversity on horizontal surfaces. Invertebrates similarly showed few differences among reefs, although there was greater diversity, primarily due to bryozoans, on the vertical surfaces of wooden reefs. Fish rapidly colonized and used all reefs, with cryptic species showing no differences among types of reefs. Schooling species were, however, more common on all of the waste reefs than on the natural sandstone reefs. Small patches of waste material dumped in estuaries can therefore provide useable habitat for a wide range of estuarine organisms and may form a valuable resource if natural habitats continue to be degraded or lost. Although we are not advocating that rubbish simply be discarded into estuaries with the excuse that it provides habitat, removal of existing rubbish should be considered in terms of multiple changes and disturbances to the environment.},

The plastic gear poses a potential source of microplastics to the coastal environment, but relevant data on the impacts of mariculture are still limited. To this end, a semi-enclosed narrow bay (i.e., Xiangshan Bay, China) with a long-term mariculture history was investigated to assess how mariculture activities affect microplastics in seawater and sediment. The results indicated that mariculture-derived microplastics accounted for approximately 55.7\% and 36.8\% of the microplastics in seawater and sediment, respectively. The average microplastic abundances of seawater and sediment were 8.9 ± 4.7 (mean ± {SD}, n ¼ 18) items/m3 seawater and 1739 ± 2153 (n ¼ 18) items/kg sediment, respectively. The types of mariculture-derived microplastics included polyethylene ({PE}) foam, {PE} nets, {PE} ﬁlm, polypropylene ({PP}) rope, polystyrene ({PS}) foam and rubber. {PE} foam had the highest proportion (38.6\%) in the seawater samples. High usage rates and the porous structure of {PE} foam led to the high abundance. The average microplastic sizes of seawater and sediment are 1.54 ± 1.53 mm and 1.33 ± 1.69 mm, respectively. The spatial variations in the abundance and size of microplastics implied that the mariculture-derived microplastics in Xiangshan Bay were transported along the Bay to the open sea. The results of this study indicate that mariculture activity can be a signiﬁcant source of microplastics. Further research is required to investigate how the high microplastic abundance in mariculture zone affects marine organisms, especially cultured seafood.},

Our results suggest that at least a fraction of the {NPAC} plastics is not in equilibrium with the surrounding seawater. For instance, “hard plastic” samples had signiﬁcantly higher {PBDE} concentrations than “nets and ropes” samples, and 29\% of them had {PBDE} composition similar to a widely used ﬂame-retardant mixture. Our ﬁndings indicate that {NPAC} plastics may pose a chemical risk to organisms as 84\% of the samples had at least one chemical exceeding sediment threshold eﬀect levels. Furthermore, our surface trawls collected more plastic than biomass (180 times on average), indicating that some {NPAC} organisms feeding upon ﬂoating particles may have plastic as a major component of their diets. If gradients for pollutant transfer from {NPAC} plastic to predators exist (as indicated by our fugacity ratio calculations), plastics may play a role in transferring chemicals to certain marine organisms.},

	abstract = {Styrofoam buoy marine debris from oyster farming presents a tough management issue in Taiwan. It is an environmental externality but its associated environmental costs have long been neglected. In the pursuit of environmental sustainability, eﬀorts by authorities have been made; yet the problem remains. In an attempt to enhance Styrofoam buoy marine debris management, this paper used document analysis, participative workshops and interviews to identify areas of concern regarding current management measures and propose recommendations. The results found that failure to impose buoy recovery, inevitable loss of buoys and unavailability of equally competitive, eco-friendly alternative buoys are major areas of concern. Built on the modes of governance (hierarchical, market and participative), the paper proposed recommendations, including enhancing farmer self-governance units' capacity to manage derelict ﬁshing gear ({DFG}), strengthening Styrofoam buoy recovery, increasing farmers' awareness of {DFG}, developing eco-friendly buoys, instituting an ecolabeling program for Styrofoam-free oysters. The recommendations involve participation of farmers, decision makers and consumers and mostly rely on the government's initiation and support. The paper particularly highlighted the political sensitivity of a recommendation regarding phasing out the use of Styrofoam buoys and suggested it serve as a last resort and be practiced depending on fulﬁllment of circumstantial situations. Finally, the paper advised extra attention be paid on public participation in regulation-making, a mismatch between the scope of the problem and the jurisdiction of a local city and adaptive management, if any change to the status quo occurs.},

	abstract = {Marine debris characterization is fundamental for developing policies aiming at ending the ﬂow of marine debris at the source. China has the largest coastal population in the world. For this emerging economy, the sources of debris might be different from those in regions at different developmental stages. As a typical coastal tourist city and a special economic zone in East China, there are multiple sources of marine debris continuously produced around Xiamen. Marine debris characterization here could provide insights into regulatory measures. Therefore, the abundance and composition of marine debris around Xiamen were investigated. Average densities of ﬂoating, beached, benthic macro-debris and ﬂoating microplastics (0.5 mm - 5 mm) were 3963 ± 2027 items km−2, 0.13 ± 0.08 items m−2, 20,274 ± 15,873 items km−2 and 36,455 ± 33,935 items km−2, respectively. Based on the Clean Coast Indexes, the beaches investigated were supposed to be “very clean” most of the time (73.2\% ± 34.9\%). Wastes with low value for recycling/reuse, such as grocery bags, ropes, and foams, were the main items of marine debris in the study area. Both domestic sources from the upstream and local ﬁshing/aquaculture activities signiﬁcantly contributed to marine debris. Obvious regional differences in benthic debris categories could be explained by both natural factors and the rural-urban gap in economic levels, waste-management strategies and infrastructure. These might be common features in this emerging market and densely populated economy. The ﬁndings provide insights into the sources of mismanaged waste around this tourist city and some neglected deﬁciencies in China's current solid waste management system.},

	abstract = {Marine plastic debris, including microplastic debris (0.315–5 mm) and large plastic debris (N5 mm), was collected from 25 beaches in Hong Kong during a wet summer season (June–August 2014) and the following dry winter season (January–March 2015). Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare the abundances and weights of seven categories of plastic debris between the two seasons. The results showed that the abundances and weights were signiﬁcantly higher (p b 0.05) in the wet season than in the dry season. Additionally, seasonal differences were detected only at the sites that were located on the west coast of Hong Kong and not at the sites on the east coast. These results suggest that the Pearl River Estuary on the west of Hong Kong plays a prominent role in the abundance and distribution of plastic debris in Hong Kong. In addition, the study indicates that estimates of microplastic abundance may be biased if samples are collected only during the wet or dry season if the sample locations are strongly inﬂuenced by a seasonal variation of riverine inputs, such as from the Pearl River.},

The ecological eﬀects caused by ﬁshing gear that is lost when cut or broken after snagging on the bottom is a growing concern to managers and scientists. Few data exist, however, to assess the impacts of lost ﬁshing gear to benthic organisms and habitat structure. In this study, 63 oﬀshore coral reef and hard-bottom sites were surveyed during 2001 to quantify the impacts of lost ﬁshing gear to coral reef sessile invertebrates. Lost hook-and-line ﬁshing gear accounted for 87\% of all debris (N ¼ 298 incidences) encountered and was responsible for 84\% of the 321 documented impacts to sponges and benthic cnidarians, predominantly consisting of tissue abrasion causing partial individual or colony mortality. Branching gorgonians (Octocorallia) were the most frequently aﬀected (56\%), followed by milleporid hydrocorals (19\%) and sponges (13\%). Factors aﬀecting the impacts of lost ﬁshing gear include sessile invertebrate density, the density of lost ﬁshing gear, and gear length. While lost hook-and-line ﬁshing gear is ubiquitous in the Florida Keys, less than 0.2\% of the available milleporid hydrocorals, stony corals, and gorgonians in the habitats studied are adversely aﬀected in terms of colony abrasions and partial mortality.},

The Global Oceanographic Data Center ({GODAC}) of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology ({JAMSTEC}) launched the Deep-sea Debris Database for public use in March 2017. The database archives photographs and videos of debris that have been collected since 1983 by deep-sea submersibles and remotely operated vehicles. From the 5010 dives in the database, 3425 man-made debris items were counted. More than 33\% of the debris was macro-plastic, of which 89\% was single-use products, and these ratios increased to 52\% and 92\%, respectively, in areas deeper than 6000 m. The deepest record was a plastic bag at 10898 m in the Mariana Trench. Deep-sea organisms were observed in the 17\% of plastic debris images, which include entanglement of plastic bags on chemosynthetic cold seep communities. Quantitative density analysis for the subset data in the western North Paciﬁc showed plastic density ranging from 17 to 335 items km−2 at depths of 1092–5977 m. The data show that, in addition to resource exploitation and industrial development, the inﬂuence of land-based human activities has reached the deepest parts of the ocean in areas more than 1000 km from the mainland. Establishment of international frameworks on monitoring of deep-sea plastic pollution as an Essential Ocean Variable and a data sharing protocol are the keys to delivering scientiﬁc outcomes that are useful for the eﬀective management of plastic pollution and the conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.},

To 12 {JTMD} hydroid species previously reported, we add an additional 16 species. Fourteen species (50\%) were detected only once; given the small fraction of debris sampled, this suggests that the diversity of the total arriving hydroid fauna was likely larger. Our ongoing studies provide the first documentation of these species being rafted from one continental margin to another. Plumalecium plumularioides (Clark, 1877) is newly reported for the Japanese hydroid fauna. Fourteen species (52\%), held to be either naturally amphi-Pacific or possibly introduced by ships at some earlier date, were already known from the Pacific coast of North America. We suggest that Obelia griffini Calkins, 1899, as represented in the {JTMD} fauna, may be a North Pacific oceanic neustonic species. We propose that Hydrodendron mirabile (Hincks, 1866) and its congeners be included in the family Phylactothecidae Stechow, 1921, here emended.

Biogeochemical and macrofauna samples were obtained from 10 diﬀerent deposition locations (location factor), under, border and distant (treatment factor) from plastic bags. The results did not show any signiﬁcant alterations in the biogeochemical parameters of the sediment due to treatment eﬀect except for summed microphytobenthic pigments. The macrobenthic community structure responded to treatment. The greatest dissimilarity (34\%) was between samples that were under and distant. Eﬀects occurred despite the high dynamics of deposition-resuspension of plastic bags and the dominance of opportunistic species. Changes in community structure are a complex result of plastic bags eﬀects on species ecological interactions in the polluted estuarine environment, attracting deposit feeders, diminishing suspension feeders and providing mechanical protection against predation by seabirds.},

	abstract = {Invasion ecology has been criticised for its lack of general principles. To explore this criticism, we conducted a meta-analysis that examined characteristics of invasiveness (i.e. the ability of species to establish in, spread to, or become abundant in novel communities) and invasibility (i.e. the susceptibility of habitats to the establishment or proliferation of invaders). There were few consistencies among invasiveness characteristics (3 of 13): established and abundant invaders generally occupy similar habitats as native species, while abundant species tend to be less aﬀected by enemies; germination success and reproductive output were signiﬁcantly positively associated with invasiveness when results from both stages (establishment/ spread and abundance/impact) were combined. Two of six invasibility characteristics were also signiﬁcant: communities experiencing more disturbance and with higher resource availability sustained greater establishment and proliferation of invaders. We also found that even though ‘propagule pressure’ was considered in only \$29\% of studies, it was a signiﬁcant predictor of both invasiveness and invasibility (55 of 64 total cases). Given that nonindigenous species are likely introduced non-randomly, we contend that ‘propagule biases’ may confound current paradigms in invasion ecology. Examples of patterns that could be confounded by propagule biases include characteristics of good invaders and susceptible habitats, release from enemies, evolution of ‘invasiveness’, and invasional meltdown. We conclude that propagule pressure should serve as the basis of a null model for studies of biological invasions when inferring process from patterns of invasion.},

In this paper, numerical modelling is used to provide a ﬁrst approximation of the pathways and accumulation of marine micro-plastics around South Africa. To account for a range of plastic classes, particles with two diﬀerent densities are considered. Low-density ({LD}) particles represent low- and high-density polyethylene while high-density ({HD}) particles are representative of Polyethylene terephthalate and Polyvinyl chloride. While the majority of micro-plastic particles that enter the ocean from the ﬁve major coastal urban-industrialised centers beach along the coastline of South Africa, a third is exported to the open ocean. {LD} and {HD} particles are primarily exported to the South Atlantic and South Indian Ocean, respectively. Particles that beach along South Africa's coastline tend to accumulate in close proximity to the coastal urban-industrialised centers.},

The spatio-temporal patterns indicate a heterogeneous distribution of plastic in the coastal areas, with higher concentrations in the north-western and south-eastern regions of the islands and debris peaking during the month of August. Furthermore, ﬂoating marine debris was more easily collected during calm seas as well as using an integrated monitoring approach to facilitate its removal.

In this study, we analyzed 17 km of video footage, collected by a Remotely Operated Vehicle ({ROV}) at depths ranging between 20 and 220 m, during 19 transects performed on the rocky banks of the Straits of Sicily. Recently, the Contracting Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity ({CBD}) recognized this site as an Ecologically or Biologically Signiﬁcant Area ({EBSA}). The research aim was to quantify the abundance of marine litter and its impact on benthic fauna. Litter density ranged from 0 items/100 m2 to 14.02 items/100 m2 with a mean (±standard error) of 2.13 (±0.84) items/100 m2. The observed average density was higher (5.2 items/ 100 m2) at depths {\textgreater}100 m than at shallower depths ({\textless}100 m, 0.71 items/100 m2). Lost or abandoned ﬁshing lines contributed to 98.07\% of the overall litter density, then representing the dominant source of marine debris. Litter interactions with fauna were frequently observed, with 30\% of litter causing “entanglement/coverage” and 15\% causing damage to sessile fauna. A total of 16 species showed interaction (entanglement/coverage or damage) with litter items and 12 of these are species of conservation concern according to international directives and agreements ({CITES}, Berne Convention, Habitat Directive, {SPA}/{BD} Protocol, {IUCN} Red List); we also observed 7 priority habitats of the {SPA}/{BD} Protocol. This research will support the implementation of monitoring “Harm” as recommended by the {UN} Environment/{MAP} Regional Plan on Marine Litter Management in the Mediterranean, and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive ({MSFD}). The institution of a {SPAMI} in the investigated area could represent a good management action for the protection of this hotspot of biodiversity and to achieve a Good Environmental Status ({GES}) for the marine environment by 2020, under the {MSFD}.},

We carried out 13 km of video recordings, by means of a remotely operated vehicle, from 10 to 210 m depth, in an anthropised area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). This site, for its high ecological importance and biodiversity value, has been identiﬁed for the establishment of a new marine protected area ({MPA}). The aim of this paper was to assess marine litter abundance and its effects on the benthic fauna. The debris density, in the study area, ranged from 0.24 to 8.01 items/100 m2, with an average of 3.49 (±0.59) items/100 m2. The derelict ﬁshing gear, mainly ﬁshing lines, were the main source of marine debris, contributing 77.9\% to the overall litter. The impacts of debris on the benthic fauna were frequently recorded, with 28.5\% of the litter entangling corals and impacting habitats of conservation concern. These impacts were exclusively caused by the derelict ﬁshing gear (91.2\% by longlines), and the highest percentage (49.1\%) of {ALDFG} causing impacts was observed from 41 to 80 m depth, in the coralligenous biocenosis. The results of the present study will help the fulﬁlment of “harm” monitoring, as recommended by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive ({MSFD}) and the {UN} Environment/{MAP} Regional Plan on the marine litter management in the Mediterranean Sea. Regarding the actions to reduce the derelict ﬁshing gear, preventive measures are usually preferred instead of the extensive removals based on cost-effectiveness and sustainability. The establishment of a new {MPA} in the area could be a good solution to reduce {ALDFG}, resulting in the improvement of the ecological status of this coastal area.},

	abstract = {The oceanic islands in the Southern Ocean can be considered amongst the remotest shores as, not only are they uninhabited (except for small research stations) and geographically isolated, but they are also enclosed by the oceanographic barrier of the Polar Frontal Zone. We survey island shores in the Scotia Arc mountain chain linking Antarctica to South America, including South Georgia, the South Sandwich archipelago and Adelaide Island oﬀ the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and compare our ﬁndings to literature reports from two other Scotia Arc island groups (South Orkney and South Shetland archipelagos). The presence of marine pollution (in the form of beached debris) in this region is signiﬁcant, both as a measure of man’s inﬂuence on this isolated environment, and due to direct dangers posed to the fauna. This paper reports the results of surveys of beached marine debris at various times in the last decade for each island group. The majority ({\textgreater}70\%) of the items recovered were anthropogenic in origin and most of these were synthetic (plastic or polystyrene). Debris densities varied from zero to 0.3 items m–1 but were typically lower than those reported from other regions of the globe. At some localities (South Georgia), marine-debris data showed a close relationship with local ﬁshery activity, whilst at others (South Sandwich Islands) debris appeared to have a more distant origin. Unlike oceanic debris in warm (non-polar) water localities, there was no evidence of any colonisation by biota. Debris accumulation may provide a useful indirect measure of local ﬁshery activity and compliance with {CCAMLR} regulations, as well as monitoring the state of the oceans and island shores.},

Granular oxidation textures were concentrated along mechanically weakened fractures and along the margins of the more rounded plastic particles. Particles with oxidation textures also produced the most intense peaks in the lower wavenumber region of {FTIR} spectra. The textural results suggest that plastic debris is particularly conducive to both chemical and mechanical breakdown in beach environments, which cannot be said for plastics in other natural settings on Earth.},

We ﬁtted mixed Hurdle models to the output datasets and performed hypotheses tests based on this framework. We found plastic to be the most abundant residue in all seasons, moon phases and tides, followed by Styrofoam and wood. Our models suggest the strongest eﬀect was due to seasonal variations, which, in turn, may be related to diﬀerent human activities. Although the dynamics of diﬀerent components showed independency of all interaction structures, plastics depended on the interaction of tide and season, whose impact over estuarine life and ecosystem services shall be further investigated.},

Harpacticoids occurred on a wide variety of objects, ranging from small plastic items to a massive floating dock. At the genus level, the harpacticoid copepod assemblage was similar to that found with floating algae by previous authors. Two of the species identified—Harpacticus nicaeensis Claus, 1866 and Dactylopodamphiascopsis latifolius (G.O. Sars, 1909)—are not previously known from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Six of the species are cosmopolitan or amphi-Pacific in distribution. None of the species were originally described from Japan, and some may have been acquired after the debris had left the Japanese coast, either from floating algae at sea or near the North American coast. Interpretation of the original source of the harpacticoids is difficult because regional taxonomic knowledge is lacking, especially for outer coast habitats where most of the tsunami debris was deposited. Identifying the harpacticoid sources is also complicated by many unresolved species complexes in the group—five of the taxa found were either very similar to or identified as species that taxonomists have regarded to be part of species complexes. Despite these difficulties, decreases over time in copepod diversity, in the frequency of unique species, and in the number of species per object, all suggest that many species were acquired in Japanese coastal waters.},

This beach is presently not affected by petrochemical facilities or pellet processing plants. The main source of fragments (96.7\%) was attributed to the breaking down of larger plastic items deposited on the beach. In the case of virgin plastic pellets (3.3\%), the main sources were the marine environment and possibly nearby port facilities.

	abstract = {The World Register of Marine Species is an over 90\% complete open-access inventory of all marine species names. Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how {WoRMS} publishes online quality assured information on marine species. Within {WoRMS}, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present {WoRMS} contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using {WoRMS} for their data management. By providing easy access to expert-validated content, {WoRMS} improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. {WoRMS}’ content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of {WoRMS}, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management.},

	abstract = {In October 2001, an unidentified didemnid ascidian, was recorded for the first time in New Zealand, smothering wharf piles and moorings in a northern harbour. A heavily-fouled barge then translocated the ascidian to an international shipping port some 500 km south, near the heart of the New Zealand mussel industry. The species was subsequently identified as Didemnum vexillum, but its status as indigenous or non-indigenous was disputed. Nonetheless, its presence was regarded as a significant threat to the mussel industry because of its demonstrated invasiveness on artificial structures, and its ability to over-grow and smother mussels. From the barge's mooring area, D. vexillum subsequently spread to the seabed beneath, and to nearby vessels and artificial structures (i.e., barges, recreational vessels, moorings, salmon cages and wharf piles). Given the likelihood that infected vectors would spread the ascidian to mussel farms in the region, and in consideration of a benefit-cost analysis, an eradication program for D. vexillum was instigated. This paper provides a chronology of events surrounding the initial detection and spread of the ascidian, and describes the development of incursion response tools for the different substrata that were infected. The treatments included smothering soft-sediment habitats with uncontaminated dredge spoil, wrapping wharf piles with plastic, smothering rip–rap habitats using a geotextile fabric, and various other approaches based on water blasting, air drying or chlorine dosing. While many of the response methods were completely effective at eliminating D. vexillum from different substrata, the program overall failed to eradicate the organism from the region. The reasons for this failure are documented, and the important lessons learned are highlighted, as a contribution to the successful management of invasive species in the future.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of ﬂoating anthropogenic debris in marine and coastal areas has environmental, economic, aesthetic, and human health impacts. Until now, modelling the transport of such debris has largely been restricted to the large-scales of open seas. We used oceanographic modelling to identify potential sites of debris accumulation along a rugged coastline with headlands, islands, rocky coasts and beaches. Our study site was the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area that has an emerging problem with debris accumulation. We found that the classical techniques of modelling the transport of ﬂoating debris models are only moderately successful due to a number of unknowns or assumptions, such as the value of the wind drift coefﬁcient, the variability of the oceanic forcing and of the wind, the resuspension of some ﬂoating debris by waves, and the poorly known relative contribution of ﬂoating debris from urban rivers and commercial and recreational shipping. Nevertheless the model was successful in reproducing a number of observations such as the existence of hot spots of accumulation. The orientation of beaches to the prevailing wind direction affected the accumulation rate of debris. The wind drift coefﬁcient and the exact timing of the release of the debris at sea affected little the movement of debris originating from rivers but it affected measurably that of debris originating from ships. It was thus possible to produce local hotspot maps for ﬂoating debris, especially those originating from rivers. Such modelling can be used to inform local management decisions, and it also identiﬁes likely priority research areas to more reliably predict the trajectory and landing points of ﬂoating debris.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic marine debris, mainly of plastic origin, is accumulating in estuarine and coastal environments around the world causing damage to fauna, ﬂora and habitats. Plastics also have the potential to accumulate in the food web, as well as causing economic losses to tourism and sea-going industries. If we are to manage this increasing threat, we must ﬁrst understand where debris is accumulating and why these locations are different to others that do not accumulate large amounts of marine debris. This paper demonstrates an advection-diffusion model that includes beaching, settling, resuspension/re-ﬂoating, degradation and topographic effects on the wind in nearshore waters to quantify the relative importance of these physical processes governing plastic debris accumulation. The aim of this paper is to prioritise research that will improve modelling outputs in the future. We have found that the physical characteristic of the source location has by far the largest effect on the fate of the debris. The diffusivity, used to parameterise the sub-grid scale movements, and the relationship between debris resuspension/ re-ﬂoating from beaches and the wind shadow created by high islands also has a dramatic impact on the modelling results. The rate of degradation of macroplastics into microplastics also have a large inﬂuence in the result of the modelling. The other processes presented (settling, wind drift velocity) also help determine the fate of debris, but to a lesser degree. These ﬁndings may help prioritise research on physical processes that affect plastic accumulation, leading to more accurate modelling, and subsequently management in the future.},

Microplastics were present in concentrations ranging from 9.20–59.9 particles per kg of dry sand sediment. The majority of microplastics identiﬁed were foam particles (55\%) and fragments (35\%). Microplastics were signiﬁcantly more abundant on heavily populated beaches compared to pristine beaches. High throughput sequencing was used to proﬁle the communities of bacteria on the surfaces of microplastic particles. The structure of the microbial communities was primarily characterised by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and were distinct across sites. Hydrocarbon-degrading genera such as Erythrobacter were dominant in areas with heavy shipping and pollution. Potential pathogenic genera such as Vibrio and Pseudomonas were also identiﬁed.

Several debris items were related to food and drink consumption on the beaches, which indicated the contribution of beach users to pollution. Most of the debris was plastic. The greatest amount of debris was found at Itaipu in January and February and at Itacoatiara in January and March, months related to both the holiday season and abundant rainfall.

Previously cleaned backreef and lagoonal reefs at two {NWHI} locations were resurveyed for accumulated debris using two survey methods. Accumulated debris densities and weights were found to be greater in lagoonal reef areas. Sample weight-based debris densities are extrapolated to similar habitats throughout the {NWHI} using a spatial ‘net habitat’ dataset created by generalizing {IKONOS} satellite derivatives for depth and habitat classiﬁcation. Prediction accuracy for this dataset is tested using historical debris point data. Annual {NWHI} debris accumulation is estimated to be 52.0 metric tonnes. For planning purposes, individual {NWHI} atolls/reefs are allotted a proportion of this total.},

This paper describes the impacts of boring isopods in aquaculture facilities and docks, quantiﬁes and discusses the implications of these microplastics, and tests if an alternate foam type prevents boring. Floats from aquaculture facilities and docks were heavily damaged by thousands of isopods and their burrows. Multiple sites in Asia, Australia, Panama, and the {USA} exhibited evidence of isopod damage. One isopod creates thousands of microplastic particles when excavating a burrow; colonies can expel millions of particles. Microplastics similar in size to these particles may facilitate the spread of non-native species or be ingested by organisms causing physical or toxicological harm. Extruded polystyrene inhibited boring, suggesting this foam may prevent damage in the ﬁeld. These results reveal boring isopods cause widespread damage to docks and are a novel source of microplastic pollution.},

Both studies concluded that foam, primarily expanded polystyrene was the dominant pollutant. Plastic was found in surface waters the full length of the Inside Passage but was concentrated near harbors. At the wrack line, an average square meter of Washington’s 1180 km of sandy beaches in the Salish Sea had 61 pieces of anthropogenic debris weighing approximately 5 g. The total loading for the entire 1 m wide band is estimated to be 72,000,000 pieces and 5.8 metric tons. Most anthropogenic debris on beaches is generated within the region.},

Therefore, creating, testing and recommending a method that not only allows comparisons of places and periods, but also the detection of source signals, will be important to reach the objectives of the source-prevention principle. This will also allow the optimisation of time, resources, and processing of samples and data. A classiﬁcation of the items found into speciﬁc categories was made according to their most probable source/use (ﬁsheries, food packaging, hazardous, sewage/personal hygiene, beach user, general home). This study tested diﬀerent widths of sampling transects to be used in the detection of plastics contamination on beaches, until all the categories were signiﬁcantly represented. Each transect had its total width (50 m) sub-divided into eight intervals of 0–2.5 m; 2.5–5 m; 5–10 m; 10–15 m; 15–20 m; 20–30 m; 30–40 m; and 40–50 m. The accumulated number of categories in the 50 m (up to 2.5 m; up to 5 m and so on) was used to determine the minimal width necessary to qualitatively characterize the area regarding plastics contamination. The diversity of the categories was directly related to the area of the sampling transect. These results indicate that a signiﬁcant increase in the number of categories in the ﬁrst intervals tend to stabilize from 15–20 m onwards.},

Even if beach litter accumulation in oceanic coasts has been analyzed quite well, new research efforts are still necessary to better understand this phenomenon along the Mediterranean coasts. This work sets out to analyze the sources of beach litter, the type of material, and the distribution and accumulation trend along the sandy coasts of the Adriatic Sea in central Italy (Abruzzo and Molise Regions, Italy). In particular, we focus on the following questions: (i) Which are the most frequent beach litter items and materials on sandy coasts? (ii) How is beach litter distributed on the different coastal dune habitats along the sea–inland gradient? Data were collected and categorized during spring 2014–2015 following the {OSPAR} guidelines in belts parallel to the shoreline and in transects perpendicular to the shoreline. Before analyzing litter abundance by classes of material, source types, and floating capacity, the spatial trends of waste accumulation along the dune zonation was also explored. Most of litter elements are in plastic, followed by styrofoam with good floating capacity. Majority of the debris derive from food packaging, fishing and recreational activities. The distribution of litter along the sea–land eco-morphological gradient is heterogeneous. The unequal accumulation amounts of debris on the upper beach, embryodunes, mobile dunes and fixed dunes threaten natural {EC} habitats in different ways. Our results stress the need of specific conservation and cleaning actions able to preserve the ecological value of {EC} coastal dune habitats.},

Abundances and chemical composition of microplastics are subject to temporal changes as a function of human activities in the areas of inﬂuence and shifting meteorological and sea-state conditions. We ﬁnd that microplastics were on average smaller in mass than other studies conducted in the Mediterranean Sea indicating longer exposure times in the environment. The microplastic aggregation potential was determined by inspecting formed biogenic aggregates either during sample collection or in the laboratory. Smaller and more angular microplastics dominated in marine aggregates, representing an average 40\% in abundance and 25\% in mass of microplastics.},

	abstract = {Marine litter is any persistent, manufactured or processed solid material discarded, disposed of or abandoned in the marine and coastal environment. Ingestion of marine litter can have lethal and sublethal effects on wildlife that accidentally ingests it, and sea turtles are particularly susceptible to this threat. The European Commission drafted the 2008/56/{EC} Marine Strategy Framework Directive with the aim to achieve a Good Environmental Status ({GES}), and the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta, Linnaeus 1758) was selected for monitoring the amount and composition of litter ingested by marine animals. An analogous decision has been made under the {UNEP}/{MAP} Barcelona Convention for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea, following the Ecosystem Approach. This work provides for the ﬁrst time, two possible scenarios for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive {GES}, both related to “Trends in the amount and composition of litter ingested by marine animals” in the Mediterranean Sea. The study validates the use of the loggerhead turtle as target indicator for monitoring the impact of litter on marine biota and calls for immediate use of this protocol throughout the Mediterranean basin and European Region. Both {GES} scenarios are relevant worldwide, where sea turtles and marine litter are present, for measuring the impact of ingested plastics and developing policy strategies to reduce it. In the period between 2011 and 2014, 150 loggerhead sea turtles, found dead, were collected from the Italian Coast, West Mediterranean Sea Sub-Region. The presence of marine litter was investigated using a standardized protocol for necropsies and lab analysis. The collected items were subdivided into 4 main categories, namely, {IND}-Industrial plastic, {USE}-User plastic, {RUB}-Non plastic rubbish, {POL}-Pollutants and 14 subcategories, to detect local diversity. Eighty-ﬁve percent of the individuals considered (n ¼ 120) were found to have ingested an average of 1.3 ± 0.2 g of litter (dry mass) or 16 ± 3 items.},

	abstract = {Paciﬁc Ocean trawl samples, stomach contents of laboratory-raised ﬁsh as well as ﬁsh from the subtropical gyres were analyzed by Raman micro-spectroscopy ({RMS}) to identify polymer residues and any detectable persistent organic pollutants ({POP}). The goal was to access speciﬁc molecular information at the individual particle level in order to identify polymer debris in the natural environment. The identiﬁcation process was aided by a laboratory generated automated ﬂuorescence removal algorithm. Paciﬁc Ocean trawl samples of plastic debris associated with ﬁsh collection sites were analyzed to determine the types of polymers commonly present. Subsequently, stomach contents of ﬁsh from these locations were analyzed for ingested polymer debris. Extraction of polymer debris from ﬁsh stomach using {KOH} versus ultrapure water were evaluated to determine the optimal method of extraction. Pulsed ultrasonic extraction in ultrapure water was determined to be the method of choice for extraction with minimal chemical intrusion. The Paciﬁc Ocean trawl samples yielded primarily polyethylene ({PE}) and polypropylene ({PP}) particles {\textgreater}1 mm, {PE} being the most prevalent type. Additional microplastic residues (1 mm - 10 mm) extracted by ﬁltration, included a polystyrene ({PS}) particle in addition to {PE} and {PP}. Flame retardant, deca-{BDE} was tentatively identiﬁed on some of the {PP} trawl particles. Polymer residues were also extracted from the stomachs of Atlantic and Paciﬁc Ocean ﬁsh. Two types of polymer related debris were identiﬁed in the Atlantic Ocean ﬁsh: (1) polymer fragments and (2) fragments with combined polymer and fatty acid signatures. In terms of polymer fragments, only {PE} and {PP} were detected in the ﬁsh stomachs from both locations. A variety of particles were extracted from oceanic ﬁsh as potential plastic pieces based on optical examination. However, subsequent {RMS} examination identiﬁed them as various non-plastic fragments, highlighting the importance of chemical analysis in distinguishing between polymer and non-polymer residues.},

	abstract = {Substantial quantities of small plastic particles, termed “microplastic,” have been found in many areas of the world ocean, and have accumulated in particularly high densities on the surface of the subtropical gyres. While plastic debris has been documented on the surface of the North Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre ({NPSG}) since the early 1970s, the ecological implications remain poorly understood. Organisms associated with ﬂoating objects, termed the “rafting assemblage,” are an important component of the {NPSG} ecosystem. These objects are often dominated by abundant and fastgrowing gooseneck barnacles (Lepas spp.), which predate on plankton and larval ﬁshes at the sea surface. To assess the potential eﬀects of microplastic on the rafting community, we examined the gastrointestinal tracts of 385 barnacles collected from the {NPSG} for evidence of plastic ingestion. We found that 33.5\% of the barnacles had plastic particles present in their gastrointestinal tract, ranging from one plastic particle to a maximum of 30 particles. Particle ingestion was positively correlated to capitulum length, and no blockage of the stomach or intestines was observed. The majority of ingested plastic was polyethylene, with polypropylene and polystyrene also present. Our results suggest that barnacle ingestion of microplastic is relatively common, with unknown trophic impacts on the rafting community and the {NPSG} ecosystem.},

They are known to interact with biota on the individual level, e.g. through ingestion, but their population-level impacts are largely unknown. One potential mechanism for microplastic-induced alteration of pelagic ecosystems is through the introduction of hard-substrate habitat to ecosystems where it is naturally rare. Here, we show that microplastic concentrations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre ({NPSG}) have increased by two orders of magnitude in the past four decades, and that this increase has released the pelagic insect
              Halobates sericeus
              from substrate limitation for oviposition. High concentrations of microplastic in the {NPSG} resulted in a positive correlation between

              and microplastic, and an overall increase in

	abstract = {The deep ocean environment is disturbed by various processes, many of which involve episodic inputs of organic matter. Some inputs Že.g., phytodetritus at mid-high latitudes in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific. are seasonally pulsed, others Že.g., falls of whale carcasses. are irregular and unpredictable, but together, they evoke a variety of responses from the benthic biota. In the case of deep-sea foraminifera, only those responses arising from seasonal food pulses have been fairly well-documented. The population dynamics of deep-sea benthic foraminifera Žtotal live populations and individual species. appear to be controlled largely by two inversely-related parameters, the flux of organic matter to the seafloor and concentrations of oxygen in the sediment porewater. Organic matter Žfood. inputs are most intense along bathyal continental margins, and their oxidation often leads to the depletion of oxygen in surface sediments. Under these conditions, foraminiferal faunas are dominated by low-oxygen tolerant, infaunal species, the abundance of which fluctuate in response to seasonally varying amounts of food and oxygen. At some sites Že.g., Sagami Bay, off Japan., species migrate up and down in the sediments, tracking critical oxygen concentrations. Where oxygen concentrations are consistently low Žless than about 0.5 ml ly1., as in parts of the California Borderland, foraminifera may undergo population increases solely in response to food pulses. In the abyssal North Atlantic, and in some continental margin areas of this ocean, organic matter inputs are weaker and do not lead to oxygen depletion within surface sediments. These systems are food limited and seasonal population fluctuations reflect the availability of food Žphytodetritus. rather than oxygen. Here, the species which respond to phytodetritus are mainly epifaunal or shallow infaunal opportunists which represent a small proportion of highly diverse communities Ž2 or 3 out of ) 120 species per core of 25.5 cm2 surface area.. Seasonal phytodetrital pulses to the deep-seafloor, and hence, foraminiferal population dynamics, are not entirely predictable. Being dependent on climatic and upper-ocean processes, they vary in intensity from year to year and occasionally Že.g., at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Ž{PAP}. in 1997. fail to materialise. Foraminiferal responses to irregular Žnon-seasonal. organic matter inputs are poorly-known. However, there is some evidence that whale falls, turbidite deposits, hydrothermal vents and seeps are exploited by species typical of organically-enriched, low-oxygen environments rather than by a specialised fauna.},

Such litter and woody debris generate the optimal conditions for ﬂoating colonizers. In this work, 26 beaches were surveyed, and 16 of them (62\%) were found to have marine fauna using litter and woody debris as a substrate for potential rafting and dispersal. Serpulidae polychaete tubes, goose barnacles Lepas (Anatifa) anserifera Linnaeus, 1767, and the bryozoans Arbopercula tenella (Hincks, 1880), Arbopercula angulata (Levinsen, 1909), plus three unidentiﬁed species were found colonizing woody debris, seeds, plastic and glass bottles. These ﬁndings of woody debris and litter facilitating the arrival and dispersal of non-native species on this coast, demonstrate that preventive management of such refuse in coastal habitats goes beyond simply preserving coastal esthetics.},

The term “beach littering” has been coined to refer to the marine litter that is deposited on beaches. This litter may come from the sea and through land-based pathways, either from remote or adjacent areas. Dirty beaches can derive in loss of aesthetical value, beach cleaning cost, environmental harm or tourism revenue reduction among others. Therefore, local authorities have started to search for cost-eﬀective approaches to understand and reduce litter accumulation in their beaches. A model is presented in this paper, which is based on Bayesian Networks and enables the forecasting of marine litter beaching at seven beaches located on the south-eastern coast of the Bay of Biscay. The model uses 9.5 years of metocean, environmental and beach cleaning data. The class to predict was deﬁned as a variable with two possible values: Low and High accumulation of beach litter. The obtained models reached an average accuracy of 65.3 ± 6.4\%, being the river ﬂow, precipitation, wind and wave the most signiﬁcant predictors and likely drivers of litter accumulation in beaches. These models may provide some insight to local authorities on the drivers aﬀecting the litter beaching and may help to deﬁne their strategies for its reduction.},

Debris was present in 14.4\% of nests surveyed, with the proportion of nests with debris varying among sites (range: 0–100\%). There was minimal overlap between the type or colour of debris found in nests and on adjacent beaches at individual sites.

	abstract = {The accumulation of plastic debris is a global environmental problem due to its durability, persistence, and abundance. Although eﬀects of plastic debris on individual marine organisms, particularly mammals and birds, have been extensively documented (e.g., entanglement and choking), very little is known about eﬀects on assemblages and consequences for ecosystem functioning. In Europe, around 40\% of the plastic items produced are utilized as single-use packaging, which rapidly accumulate in waste management facilities and as litter in the environment. A range of biodegradable plastics have been developed with the aspiration of reducing the persistence of litter; however, their impacts on marine assemblages or ecosystem functioning have never been evaluated. A ﬁeld experiment was conducted to assess the impact of conventional and biodegradable plastic carrier bags as litter on benthic macroand meio-faunal assemblages and biogeochemical processes (primary productivity, redox condition, organic matter content, and pore-water nutrients) on an intertidal shore near Dublin, Ireland. After 9 weeks, the presence of either type of bag created anoxic conditions within the sediment along with reduced primary productivity and organic matter and signiﬁcantly lower abundances of infaunal invertebrates. This indicates that both conventional and biodegradable bags can rapidly alter marine assemblages and the ecosystem services they provide.},

	abstract = {Plastic litter and debris of all kinds is conspicuous on many contemporary shorelines, most frequently near populated and industrial centres, but also on remote and seldomvisited or uninhabited islands, including Raoul, Campbell and Auckland Islands. Pollution by plastics is aesthetically distasteful and unnecessary, and also creates a number of environmental problems: e.g. death and/or debilitation of wildlife through entanglement; blockages to the intestinal tract through ingestion leading to starvation and death, or ulceration of delicate tissues by jagged fragments; reduction in quality of life and reproductive performance. Larger items may also hazard shipping. An encrusting pseudoplanktic biota, similar to that found on floating Sargassum and other seaweeds has been recognised on drift plastics. Alien species, rafted on drifting plastic, could endanger the flora and fauna of protected and conservation island ecosystems. The sources of plastic pollution can be both distant (the truly 'oceanic' debris which has drifted from afar) and regional and local (e.g. shipping, fishing and recreational boating activities). Data compiled during a recent clean-up campaign on beaches of the inner Hauraki Gulf islands suggest that nearby land-based sources are also important. There is need to educate the public about the environmental problems arising from the indiscriminate disposal of plastics and other persistent synthetic compounds. It is unlikely that these problems can ever be solved by regulation, although, along with technological advances, that could alleviate them.},

	abstract = {Over the past five or six decades, contamination and pollution of the world’s enclosed seas, coastal waters and the wider open oceans by plastics and other synthetic, non-biodegradable materials (generally known as ‘marine debris’) has been an ever-increasing phenomenon. The sources of these polluting materials are both land- and marine-based, their origins may be local or distant, and the environmental consequences are many and varied. The more widely recognized problems are typically associated with entanglement, ingestion, suffocation and general debilitation, and are often related to stranding events and public perception. Among the less frequently recognized and recorded problems are global hazards to shipping, fisheries and other maritime activities. Today, there are rapidly developing research interests in the biota attracted to freely floating (i.e. pelagic) marine debris, commonly known as ‘hangers-on and hitch-hikers’ as well as material sinking to the sea floor despite being buoyant. Dispersal of aggressive alien and invasive species by these mechanisms leads one to reflect on the possibilities that ensuing invasions could endanger sensitive, or at-risk coastal environments (both marine and terrestrial) far from their native habitats.},

These species are herein described in detail and illustrated by scanning electron microscopy. Nine species (23\% of total) are described as new (Electra asiatica, Callopora sarae, Conopeum nakanosum, Cauloramphus cryptoarmatus, Cauloramphus multispinosus, Cauloramphus niger, Stomachetosella decorata, Microporella luellae, and Celleporina minima), and 21 species (54\%) are reported for the first time from Japan. Species richness ranged from eight to 29 species per study site. A {TWINSPAN} analysis showed the species fell into nine groups defined by the local pattern of distribution. A cluster analysis of study sites based on similarity of species composition showed three faunistic groups distributed geographically: in Akkeshi Lake, along the eastern-central shore of the bay, and at the mouth of the bay. Species richness in estuarine Akkeshi Lake was low, with a species composition very different from the outer bay. Most cheilostomes were found on rock and shell substrata, but uncommonly occurred on concrete walls, algae, hydroids, tubes of polychaetes, other bryozoans, and anthropogenic debris. Of the 39 species found, 33 (85\%) contained embryos during the collecting periods, 2–7 June and 3–6 July 2004. The biogeographical composition of intertidal cheilostomes at Akkeshi Bay included species with Arctic-Boreal (28\%), Boreal (59\%), and Boreal-Subtropical (13\%) distributions. The overall species richness of intertidal cheilostomes was two-thirds that documented intertidally in a comparable study at Kodiak, Alaska, a locality 15u higher in latitude. We attribute the lower richness at Akkeshi to differences in the nearshore marine environment between the two localities.},

The distribution and abundance of marine litter were calculated by recordings of bycatch from the pelagic trawling in upper 60 m, from bottom trawling close to the sea ﬂoor, and ﬂoating marine debris at surface by visual observations. The study is comprehensive regarding coverage and number with registrations from 2,265 pelagic trawls and 1,860 bottom trawls, in addition to surface registration between the stations. Marine litter has been recorded from 301 pelagic and 624 of the bottom trawl catches. In total, 784 visual observations of ﬂoating marine debris were recorded during the period. Marine litter has been categorized according to volume or weight of the material types plastic, wood, metal, rubber, glass, paper, and textile. Marine litter is observed in the entire Barents Sea and distribution vary with material densities, ocean currents and depth. Plastic dominated number of observations with marine litter, as 72\% of surface observations, 94\% of pelagic trawls, and 86\% of bottom trawls contained plastic. Observations of wood constituted 19\% of surface observations, 1\% of pelagic trawls, and 17\% of bottom trawls with marine litter. Materials from other categories such as metal, rubber, paper, textile, and glass were observed sporadically. Recordings of wood dominated surface observations (61.9 ± 21.6\% by volume) and on seaﬂoor (59.4 ± 35.0\% by weight), while plastic dominated marine litter observations in upper 60 m depth (86.4 ± 16.5\% by weight) over these 7 years. Based on recordings and volume or area covered, mean levels of plastic in the upper 60 m of the Barents Sea were found to 0.011 mg m−3 (pelagic) and 2.9 kg km−2 at sea ﬂoor over the study period. Average levels of marine litter (all material types) at the sea ﬂoor were found to be 26 kg km−2.},

	abstract = {Marine litter problem has gained great attetion in regional seas and lead to degredation and threaten aquatic life in marine environment. Coastal marine litter in the Black Sea is mainly caused by transportation and deposition of antropogenic waste resulting from river outflows. Measures and regulations remain inadequate to protect the coastal regions against pollution in the region. Geomorphology of the region creates many watersheds supplied by extensive stream networks. To estimate litter load on the Black Sea coastal areas 15 streams were surveyed. Study area is densely populated coastal region with scattered settlemets toward steep higher areas. Dry solid waste load is triggered by settlement plan and leads to accumulation of marine litter in coastal areas. Regional precipitation characteristic of the region determines flood timing and frequency with very high rainfall records. Composition and distrubution of sampled marine litter is carried out by identifying litter type propotionality to total load. Plastic has the highest ratio of 56\% among all litter type. Yearly total litter load for Degirmendere stream is estimated 102.25 m3/year for 100 ha. Multispectral satellite images are used to asses transportation of floating or drifting litter from coastal areas to inner basin. Man made alterations of coastal areas are also evaluated in terms of aquatic living resources and pollution. Main problems are stressed and possible solutions and implications are given to reduce pollution problem in coastal areas.},

We conducted a multi-annual survey on litter at the sea surface and on the seaﬂoor in the south-eastern North Sea. Bottom trawling was identiﬁed as a major source of marine litter. Oceanographic modelling revealed that the distribution of ﬂoating litter in the North Sea is largely determined by the site of origin of ﬂoating objects whereas the trajectories are strongly inﬂuenced by wind drag. Methods adopted from species distribution modelling indicated that resuspension of benthic litter and nearbottom transport processes strongly inﬂuence the distribution of litter on the seaﬂoor. Major sink regions for ﬂoating marine litter were identiﬁed at the west coast of Denmark and in the Skagerrak.

Animals found on floating patches represent not just ephemeral assemblages but persistent local populations. Drift material collected in the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic, and the North Sea harboured populations of up to about 50 animals including all developmental stages. In laboratory experiments the species proved to be able to establish populations on spatially limited, isolated substrates. The capacity of 5-litre-microcosms for I. metallica was about 130 animals. In the presence of the coastally distributed congener Idotea baltica, however, laboratory populations of I. metallica went extinct within 12 weeks. Even though high colonisation rates can be expected in coastal waters because of high patch densities, metapopulation persistence is mostly restricted to the open sea. In coastal waters extinction rate of local populations increases because of patch destruction and the species’ inferiority to coastally distributed competitors. Due to high uncertainties in estimating patch densities, it is difficult to determine the parameters underlying metapopulation dynamics such as the migration rate and the rate of patch occupancy.},

	abstract = {A field experiment was devised to test whether meiofauna that colonised mimic pneumatophores (artificial substrates) resembled the assemblage on adjacent live pneumatophores in three randomly chosen intertidal, estuarine sites. The experiment showed that the close proximity of particular biota on living pneumatophores did not reliably influence subsequent development of assemblages upon mimic pneumatophores within a scale of 10 m during a colonisation period of less than 20 weeks. There was some convergence of the composition of the colonising assemblage of meiofauna on mimic pneumatophores with the local assemblages in sites dominated by barnacles, or where the natural pneumatophores were free from macroscopic epibionts. However, tychopelagic meiofauna from algal epiphytes did not significantly colonise mimic pneumatophores during the 20week trial, probably due a lack of growing algae. During the conditioning phase suspended in water at a marine site 20 km from the mangroves, mimic pneumatophores acquired an assemblage of meiofauna different from the estuarine assemblage that colonised mimics following implantation in the estuarine mudflat. Enhanced colonisation rates of mimics in suspended bags at the conditioning site may be explained by the absence of benthic macroinvertebrates, and the lack of intertidal exposure. Biofilms aged 2, 7, and 11 weeks had no consistent, different effect on the subsequent colonisation of meiofauna. We conclude that divergence of phytal-based assemblages of meiofauna depends upon the amount of coverage, as well as the type, of fouling macro-epibionts on the pneumatophores. Meiofaunal assemblages on artificial substrates after 20 weeks colonisation displayed less intrinsic patchiness than mature phytal assemblages on natural pneumatophores, and so present a potentially useful way of improving the power of biomonitoring applications using meiofauna.},

	abstract = {The Anxious Bay beach litter clearance is the longest running annual survey of ocean-based litter in Australia. It’s remoteness from centres of human population and location (with respect to prevailing winds and currents) make it an ideal place for monitoring ocean or ship-based litter in Australia’s southern oceans and particularly, the Great Australian Bight. Over the 1991–1999 period, a large but gradual decline in the amount of beach washed litter was recorded (with minor peaks recorded during the 1992 and 1994 surveys). Beach washed litter decreased by approximately 86\%, from 344 kg recorded in 1991 (13.2 kg/km) to 49 kg in 1999 (i.e. 1.9 kg/km), reaching a maximum of 390 kg in 1992 (or 15 kg/km of beach). However, a sharp increase in litter was recorded in 2000 (i.e. 252 kg or 9.7 kg/km). This increase in litter yield in 2000 is probably due to stronger than average onshore surface ﬂow (or Ekman Transport) in the western Eyre Peninsula and Bight region. Prior to the survey in 2000, the results appeared to indicate that ocean litter on Anxious Bay beach was beginning to level out at around 50–70 kg/year (i.e. 2–3 kg/km). As the beach surveys involve the assumption that the beach is completely cleared of litter, this may represent a baseline level for ocean-based litter in the region. The yields and type of litter collected from the annual survey indicates that the majority of litter washed ashore originates from commercial ﬁshing activities within the Great Australian Bight. Most of the ﬁshing-related litter was directly sourced to the Southern Rock Lobster Fishery (i.e. bait buckets, baskets, pots), the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery (i.e. codends, trawl nets) and the Southern Shark Fishery (i.e. monoﬁlament gillnets and longlines).},

Haliclona xena de Weerdt, 1986, known previously only from western Europe (and where it is regarded as introduced from an unknown region) is here newly reported from the Tohoku coast of Honshu, as is Halisarca “dujardini Johnston, 1842”. Five species (Mycale macginitei, Hymeniacidon sinapium, Ute sp., Haliclona xena and Halisarca “dujardini”) were observed only once. Multiple lines of evidence (including lack of colonization by uniquely Eastern Pacific sponge species, the arrival in Hawai‘i of some of the same species whose only possible origin was Japan, and the low probability of coastal sponge larvae colonizing {JTMD} in the open ocean) indicate that the sponges on {JTMD} originate from the Western Pacific.

	abstract = {To support microplastic management, the abundance, composition, and spatial distribution of microplastics on a national scale must be known. Hence, we studied the baseline level of microplastic pollution at 20 sandy beaches along the South Korean coast. All microplastic particles extracted from the sand samples were identiﬁed down to 20 mm in size using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The abundances of large microplastics (L-{MPs}; 1e5 mm) and small microplastics (S-{MPs}; 0.02e1 mm) were in the range of 0e2088 n/m2 and 1400e62800 n/m2, respectively. Maximum microplastic abundance was in the size range of 100e150 mm, and particles smaller than 300 mm accounted for 81\% of the total abundance. Expanded polystyrene ({EPS}) accounted for 95\% of L-{MPs}, whereas S-{MPs} were predominantly composed of polyethylene (49\%) and polypropylene (38\%). The spatial distribution of L-{MPs}, excluding {EPS}, was signiﬁcantly related to population, precipitation, proximity to a river mouth and abundance of macroplastic debris on beach. However, there were no relationships between S-{MPs} and other environmental and source-related factors, except for macroplastic debris and L-{MPs} excluding {EPS}. These results imply that S-{MPs} are mainly produced on beaches by weathering, whereas L-{MPs} other than {EPS} are mainly introduced from land-based sources and are also partly produced on beaches.},

	abstract = {Marine litter pollution is now becoming a growing issue for the coastal regions, in particular for enclosed and highly populated water bodies, like the Baltic Sea. The metropolitan area of St.Petersburg together with the Leningrad Oblast produces annually about 112 000 tons of plastic wastes. Due to no centralized system of plastic litter separation and treatment all wastes are stored in landfills, with much of it eventually finding its way to the adjacent waters (rivers, lakes and the sea) and migrating through the borders. Great amount of litter is accumulated on the beaches of the Gulf of Finland. At the same time the water area of the Gulf can serve itself as a source of beach pollution by plastic particles released from bottom sediments during repeated dredging works in the Neva Bay. The plastic litter problem has never been investigated for the Russian sector of the Gulf and also requires joint efforts from the neighbor countries (Estonia). The study presents a review of marine macrolitter monitoring methods for the beaches of the Eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. For now there is no single method elaborated for beach monitoring of marine litter for European water bodies. Based on the results of recent studies in the central part of the Baltic, analysis of beach and coast types in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland, and results of public monitoring campaigns the most suitable method is discussed to be tested in summer 2018 in several urban and rural spots along the coastline of the Neva estuary, the Kurortny District and the Southern coast of the Gulf.},

Accumulation rates at some beaches were dependent on tide and onshore winds. Most of the 6389 items collected were plastic (Macquarie 95\%, Heard 94\%) and discarded or lost ﬁshing gear comprised 22\% of those plastic items. Stalked barnacles (Lepas spp.) were a regular attachment on Macquarie debris but not at Heard Island. The daily accumulation rate of plastic debris on Macquarie Island was an order of magnitude higher than that estimated from monthly surveys during the same 4 months in the previous 5 years. This ﬁnding suggests that estimates of the oceans’ plastic loading are an order of magnitude too low.},

	abstract = {Alien species are introduced to new regions in many different ways and for different purposes. A number of frameworks have been developed to group such pathways of introduction into discrete categories in order to improve our understanding of biological invasions, provide information for interventions that aim to prevent introductions, enable reporting to national and international organisations and facilitate the prediction of threats. The introduction pathway classification framework proposed by the Convention on Biological Diversity ({CBD}) as a global standard is comprised of six main categories and 44 sub-categories. However, issues have arisen with its implementation. In this position paper, we outline five desirable properties of an introduction pathway classification framework – it should be compatible (i.e. the level of detail of the categories is similar to that of the available data), actionable (i.e. categories link to specific interventions), general (i.e. categories are applicable across the contexts that are of interest (e.g. taxa, habitats and regions)), equivalent (i.e. categories are equivalent in their level of detail) and distinct (i.e. categories are discrete and easily distinguished) – termed the {CAGED} properties. The six main categories of the {CBD} framework have all of the {CAGED} properties, but the detailed sub-categories have few. Therefore, while the framework has been proposed by the {CBD} as a global standard and efforts have been made to put it into practice, we argue that there is room for improvement. We conclude by presenting scenarios for how the issues identified could be addressed, noting that a hybrid model might be most appropriate.},

Importantly, a strong correlation between micro- and mesoplastic concentrations was identified. Secondly, a classification based on the shape and appearance of microplastics indicated the predominant presence of fragments (73 \%) followed by thin films (14 \%). Thirdly, the average mass ratio of microplastic to dry organic matter has been measured at 0.5, revealing a significant presence of microplastics in comparison to plankton. Finally, a correction method was applied in order to correct wind mixing effect on microplastics’ vertical distribution. This data allows for a comprehensive view, for the first time, of the spatial distribution and nature of plastic debris in the Western Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract = {Studies on marine debris have gained worldwide attention since many types of debris have found their way into the food chain of higher organisms. Thus, it is crucial that more focus is given to this area in order to curb contaminations in sea food. This study was conducted to quantify plastic debris buried in sand at selected beaches in Malaysia. Marine debris was identified according to size range and distribution, and this information was related to preventive actions to improve marine waste issues. For the purpose of this study, comparison of plastic waste abundance between a recreational beach and fish-landing beaches was also carried out, since the different beach types represent different activities that produce debris. Six beaches along the Malaysian coastline were selected for this study. The plastic types in this study were related to the functions of the beach. While recreational beaches have abundant quantities of plastic film, foamed plastic including polystyrene, and plastic fragment, fish-landing beaches accumulated line and foamed plastic. A total of 2542 pieces (265.30 g m-2) of small plastic debris were collected from all six beaches, with the highest number from Kuala Terengganu, at 879 items m-2 on Seberang Takir Beach, followed by Batu Burok Beach with 780 items m-2. Findings from studies of Malaysian beaches have provided a clearer understanding of the distribution of plastic debris. This demonstrates that commitments and actions, such as practices of the ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’ (3R) approach, supporting public awareness programmes and beach clean-up activities, are essential in order to reduce and prevent plastic debris pollution.},

	abstract = {Recent estimates suggest that roughly 100 times more plastic litter enters the sea than is found ﬂoating at the sea surface, despite the buoyancy and durability of many plastic polymers. Biofouling by marine biota is one possible mechanism responsible for this discrepancy. Microplastics ({\textless}5 mm in diameter) are more scarce than larger size classes, which makes sense because fouling is a function of surface area whereas buoyancy is a function of volume; the smaller an object, the greater its relative surface area. We tested whether plastic items with high surface area to volume ratios sank more rapidly by submerging 15 different sizes of polyethylene samples in False Bay, South Africa, for 12 weeks to determine the time required for samples to sink. All samples became sufﬁciently fouled to sink within the study period, but small samples lost buoyancy much faster than larger ones. There was a direct relationship between sample volume (buoyancy) and the time to attain a 50\% probability of sinking, which ranged from 17 to 66 days of exposure. Our results provide the ﬁrst estimates of the longevity of different sizes of plastic debris at the ocean surface. Further research is required to determine how fouling rates differ on free ﬂoating debris in different regions and in different types of marine environments. Such estimates could be used to improve model predictions of the distribution and abundance of ﬂoating plastic debris globally.},

We test whether this pattern is evident in beach litter in the same region. Freshly stranded beach litter was collected at increasing distances (0 km, 100 km, 200 km and 2800 km) from Cape Town, a major urban litter source. Mean size and buoyancy of litter items increased signiﬁcantly with distance from Cape Town. Size-speciﬁc sedimentation due to the ballasting effect of biofouling is a plausible explanation for the disappearance of smaller, less buoyant items. Our results provide further evidence that many low buoyancy items sink and support the hypothesis that size and buoyancy are strong predictors of dispersal distance for ﬂoating debris.},

Seventeen aquaculture sites were sampled along the Mediterranean coast, collecting samples by scraping fouling organisms directly from the ropes. Additionally, thirty publications were reviewed, in order to assess the similarity of aquaculture fouling with other fouling communities. Our results reflect that amphipods accounted for more than 80\% of the epifauna associated with farms fouling communities. This characteristic epifauna was defined by seven amphipod species well-adapted to colonise and survive in these off-coast habitats. Most species common in farms have also been commonly found in harbours, marinas, and/or offshore on turtles, buoys or platforms etc., showing a great resistance to polluted areas but also to dispersal via rafting on floating objects. In this study, two exotic species were identified: Caprella scaura and Stenothoe georgiana, the latter being the first report from the Mediterranean Sea.

Fouling was sampled on rafted items (set adrift by the Tohoku tsunami that struck northeastern Honshu in March 2011) landing in North America and the Hawaiian Islands. Seventeen species of shallow-water benthic foraminifera were recovered from these debris objects. Eleven species are regarded as having been acquired in Japan, while two additional species (Planogypsina squamiformis (Chapman, 1901) and Homotrema rubra (Lamarck, 1816)) were obtained in the Indo-Pacific as those objects drifted into shallow tropical waters before turning north and east to North America. Four species were acquired after the debris came ashore in Hawaii and in North America. As previously shown for the Japanese species Trochammina hadai Uchio, 1962 and the Indo-Pacific species Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, 1976, introduced foraminiferal species may rapidly proliferate and disperse, negatively impacting native species. In the geologic past, panoceanic rafting must have been relatively infrequent, as it would have floating pumice and vegetation with relatively limited potential for multiyear survival at sea. In modern times, the ever-increasing abundance of floatable plastic artifacts emplaced along tectonic coastlines provides a greater abundance of more permanent materials for tsunami- and storm-generated rafts that can introduce foraminifera and other marine biota to distant shorelines.},

	abstract = {During the German–Russian expedition {KuramBio} (Kuril–Kamchatka Biodiversity Studies) to the northwest Paciﬁc Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and its adjacent abyssal plain, we found several kinds and sizes of plastic debris ranging from ﬁshing nets and packaging to microplastic in the sediment of the deep-sea ﬂoor. Microplastics were ubiquitous in the smaller fractions of the box corer samples from every station from depths between 4869 and 5766 m. They were found on the abyssal plain and in the sediments of the trench slope on both sides. The amount of microplastics differed between the stations, with lowest concentration of 60 pieces per m2 and highest concentrations of more than 2000 pieces per m2. Around 75\% of the microplastics (deﬁned here as particles o 1 mm) we isolated from the sediment samples were ﬁbers. Other particles were paint chips or small cracked pieces of unknown origin. The Kuril–Kamchatka Trench area is known for its very rich marine fauna (Zenkevich, 1963). Yet we can only guess how these microplastics accumulated in the deep sea of the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area and what consequences the microplastic itself and its adsorbed chemicals will have on this very special and rich deep-sea fauna. But we herewith present an evaluation of the different kinds of plastic debris we found, as a documentation of human impact into the deep sea of this region of the Northwest Paciﬁc.},

	abstract = {Beach environments are known to be conducive to fragmentation of plastic debris, and highly fragmented plastic particles can interact with smaller organisms. Even through stranded plastic debris may not interact directly with marine organisms, backwash processes may transport this debris back to coastal waters, where it may affect a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. This study analysed the size distribution of stranded plastic debris ({\textless}10 mm) collected from eight coastal beaches in Guangdong Province, China. Polystyrene ({PS}) foams and fragments smaller than 7 mm were increasingly abundant in the smaller size classes, whereas resin pellets remained in their production sizes ({\textasciitilde}3 mm). Microplastics ({\textless}5 mm) accounted for over 98\% of the total plastic debris by abundance and 71\% by weight, indicating that the plastic debris on these coastal beaches was highly fragmented and the majority of the plastic masses belonged to the microplastic size range. The observed size distributions of {PS} foams and fragments are believed to result from continued fragmentation. Previous studies found that the residence time of beached debris was less than one year on average, and no sign of plastic accumulation with depth in beach sediment was observed. Therefore, coastal beaches may represent a reservoir of highly fragmented and degraded microplastics that may be mobilised and returned to the sea during storm events. Further research on the dynamics and longevity of microplastics on beaches will help reveal the mass balance of microplastics on the shoreline and determine whether shorelines are sinks or sources of microplastics.},

We performed the ﬁrst harmonized assessment of seaﬂoor litter (trawl and visual surveys) in six countries of the Adriatic-Ionian macroregion. Seaﬂoor litter showed an uneven distribution throughout the area, with large diﬀerences in litter densities and composition among countries and locations. An emerging problem in the area resulted in short-term \& single-use objects that represented the largest fraction of litter. Packaging was the economic sector contributing most to seaﬂoor litter on the continental shelf and upper slope, while in some areas aquaculture (mussel farming) represented a key activity producing marine litter. In coastal areas and bays (e.g. Boka Kotorska bay, Montenegro), seaﬂoor litter was mainly related to construction activities and electronic goods, which are a consequence of ﬂy-tipping/illegal dumping.},

Eroded {HDPE} demonstrated an altered surface topography and color and new functional groups. Eroded {PET} surface was uneven, yellow, and occasionally, colonized by microbes. A decrease in Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) peaks was observed for eroded {PET} suggesting that degradation had occurred. For eroded {PVC}, its surface became more lamellar and a new {FTIR} peak was observed.

Direct observations of this key ecological and evolutionary process are, however, critically lacking. The importance of macroalgal rafting as a dispersal mechanism has remained uncertain, largely owing to lack of knowledge about the capacity of fauna to survive long voyages at sea and successfully make landfall and establish. Here, we directly document the rafting of a diverse assemblage of intertidal organisms across several hundred kilometres of open ocean, from the subantarctic to mainland New Zealand. Multispecies analyses using phylogeographic and ecological data indicate that 10 epifaunal invertebrate species rafted on six large bull kelp specimens for several weeks from the subantarctic Auckland and/or Snares Islands to the Otago coast of New Zealand, a minimum distance of some 400–600 km. These genetic data are the first to demonstrate that passive rafting can enable simultaneous trans-oceanic transport and landfall of numerous coastal taxa.},

	abstract = {The concentration and spatial distribution of microplastics in the Bay of Brest (Brittany, France) was investigated in two surveys. Surface water and sediment were sampled at nine locations in areas characterized by contrasting anthropic pressures, riverine inﬂuences or water mixing. Microplastics were categorized by their polymer type and size class. Microplastic contamination in surface water and sediment was dominated by polyethylene fragments ({PE}, 53e67\%) followed by polypropylene ({PP}, 16 e30\%) and polystyrene ({PS}, 16e17\%) microparticles. The presence of buoyant microplastics ({PE}, {PP} and {PS}) in sediment suggests the existence of physical and/or biological processes leading to vertical transfer of lightweight microplastics in the bay. In sediment (upper 5 cm), the percentage of particles identiﬁed by Raman micro-spectroscopy was lower (41\%) than in surface water (79\%) and may explain the apparent low concentration observed in this matrix (0.97 ± 2.08 {MP} {kgÀ}1 dry sediment). Mean microplastic concentration was 0.24 ± 0.35 {MP} {mÀ}3 in surface water. We suggest that the observed spatial {MP} distribution is related to proximity to urbanized areas and to hydrodynamics in the bay. A particle dispersal model was used to study the inﬂuence of hydrodynamics on surface microplastic distribution. The outputs of the model showed the presence of a transitional convergence zone in the centre of the bay during ﬂood tide, where ﬂoating debris coming from the northern and southern parts of the bay tends to accumulate before being expelled from the bay. Further modelling work and observations integrating (i) the complex vertical motion of microplastics, and (ii) their point sources is required to better understand the fate of microplastics in such a complex coastal ecosystem.},

Yet, a relatively low number of studies have investigated the nature of microplastic associated bacterial communities in coastal ecosystems and the potential factors inﬂuencing their composition and structure. Here, we characterized microplastics collected in the Bay of Brest by manual sorting followed by Raman spectroscopy and studied their associated bacterial assemblages using 16S amplicon highthroughput sequencing. Our methodology allowed discriminating polymer type (polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene) within small size ranges (0.3e1 vs. 1e2 vs. 2e5 mm) of microplastics collected. Data showed high species richness and diversity on microplastics compared to surrounding seawater samples encompassing both free living and particle attached bacteria. Even though a high proportion of operational taxonomic units ({OTU}; 94 ± 4\%) was shared among all plastic polymers, polystyrene fragments exhibited distinct bacterial assemblages as compared to polyethylene and polypropylene samples. No effect of microplastic size was revealed regardless of polymer type, site and date of collection. The Vibrio genus was commonly detected in the microplastic fraction and speciﬁc {PCR} were performed to determine the presence of potentially pathogenic Vibrio strains (namely V. aestuarianus and the V. splendidus polyphyletic group). V. splendidus related species harboring putative oyster pathogens were detected on most microplastic pools (77\%) emphasizing the need of further research to understand the role of microplastics on pathogen population transport and ultimate disease emergence.},

Average concentrations recorded were 0.034 ± 0.032 and 0.176 ± 0.278 mps {mÀ}2 and 0.005 ± 0.005 and 0.028 ± 0.043 {MPS} {mÀ}2, respectively for 2013 and 2014. Results on this emerging topic are discussed as a preliminary step towards implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the region. Harmonization of protocols for determination of plastic particles is urgently needed in order to compare results between regions and to ensure coherence in the implementation of the {MSFD}. This aspect is also important at a worldwide scale.},

	abstract = {Plastic particles are ubiquitous in the marine environment. Given their low density, they have the tendency to ﬂoat on the sea surface, with possible impacts on the sea surface microlayer ({SML}). The {SML} is an enriched bioﬁlm of marine organic matter, that plays a key role in biochemical and photochemical processes, as well as controlling gas exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. Recent studies indicate that plastics can interfere with the microbial cycling of carbon. However, studies on microplastic accumulation in the {SML} are limited, and their effects on organic matter cycling in the surface ocean are poorly understood. To explore potential dynamics in this key ocean compartment, we ran a controlled experiment with standard microplastics in the surface and bulk water of a marine monoculture. Bacterial abundance, chromophoric dissolved organic matter ({CDOM}), and oxygen concentrations were measured. The results indicate an accumulation of {CDOM} in the {SML} and immediate underlying water when microplastic particles are present, as well as an enhanced oxygen consumption. If extrapolated to a typical marine environment, this indicates that alterations in the quality and reactivity of the organic components of the {SML} could be expected. This preliminary study shows the need for a more integrated effort to our understanding the impact of microplastics on {SML} functioning and marine biological processes.},

In the Gulf of Lions, only small amounts of debris were collected on the continental shelf. Most of the debris was found in canyons descending from the continental slope and in the bathyal plain, with high amounts occurring to a depth of more than 500 m. An additional cruise was undertaken using the manned submersible Cyana (provided by {IFREMER}). Sixteen dives (46.07 km distance on the floor) conducted in canyons off Marseilles and Nice (France) ranging from 40 to 1448 m in depth, enabled us to locate accumulation areas.

This study aims to evaluate the type and density of marine litter in two shallow ﬁshing grounds in the {NW} Mediterranean Sea, both belonging to the Natura 2000 network. Moreover, it quantiﬁes the fraction of marine litter within the total catch to help understand the potential inﬂuence of marine litter on ﬁsheries. Two study areas were selected, one in the vicinity of urban populated areas and high navigational trafﬁc and one in a rural site off an agricultural area. The urban area had more benthic marine litter (393 to 198 kg {kmÀ}2) including clinker (residue from coal-burning steamships), fabric, plastics, and processed wood and accounting for up to 38\% of the total catch. The rural area had far less marine litter (34–56 kg {kmÀ}2), accounting for only 5\% of the total catch. Marine litter may have potential negative effects on ﬁsheries; thus we propose that government credit trading programs could be promoted to help recover litter from ﬁshing catches, to reduce ﬁshing costs and hazards to marine ecosystems.},

The results showed that litter can support high densities of marine organisms and represent a new habitat in the studied coast. The taxonomic proﬁle of the communities supported by marine litter and hard natural substrate were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Moreover, opposite to the expectations of reduced diversity in artiﬁcial structures, more diverse communities were found on litter. Non-indigenous species were attached mainly to non-plastic artiﬁcial materials.

	abstract = {Since 2007, massive green tides have occurred every summer in the southern Yellow Sea ({YS}), China. They have caused severe ecological consequences and huge economic losses. Ulva prolifera originated from Subei Shoal of the {YS} was conﬁrmed as causative species of the green tides. The Porphyra yezoensis aquaculture rafts in the Subei Shoal have been highly suspected to be the “seed bed” of the green tides, because U. prolifera abundantly fouled the Porphyra yezoensis aquaculture facilities. Besides, various habitats of aquaculture ponds along the Jiangsu coastline and mudﬂat in the Subei Shoal were proposed to be possible sources of green tides. To understand the “seed” of the green tides in the southern {YS} and mitigate the original biomass of the green tide, various materials used as substrates for the germination of U. prolifera gametes were tested in this study. Culture experiments showed the following: 1) materials used in the P. yezoensis rafts (plastic, bamboo, jute rope, plastic rope, nylon netting, and plastic netting) displayed a signiﬁcantly higher germination rate than those associated with mudﬂats and aquaculture ponds (mud, sand and rock); 2) plastics were the best substrates for the germination of U. prolifera gametes; 3) poor germination was found on old fronds of U. prolifera,, and rubber showed inhibitory effect on germination. The success in germination on P. yezoensis rafts related materials supports the notion that these mariculture structures may be involved in acting as a seed bed for green tide macroalgae. The lack of germination on rubber surfaces may suggest one way to limit the proliferation of early stages of U. prolifera.},

Here we present a new type of plastic pollution, the ‘plasticrusts’, plastic debris encrusting the rocky surface, recently discovered in the intertidal rocky shores of a volcanic Atlantic island. The potential impact that these new ‘plasticrusts’ may have needs to be further explored, as e.g. potential ingestion by intertidal organisms could suppose a new pathway for entrance of plastics into marine food webs. Consequently, its inclusion as a potential new marine debris category in management and monitoring actions should be pondered.},

          , 
            Each year vast amounts of plastic are produced worldwide. When released to the environment, plastics accumulate, and plastic debris in the world's oceans is of particular environmental concern. More than 60\% of all floating debris in the oceans is plastic and amounts are increasing each year. Plastic polymers in the marine environment are exposed to sunlight, oxidants and physical stress, and over time they weather and degrade. The degradation processes and products must be understood to detect and evaluate potential environmental hazards. Some attention has been drawn to additives and persistent organic pollutants that sorb to the plastic surface, but so far the chemicals generated by degradation of the plastic polymers themselves have not been well studied from an environmental perspective. In this paper we review available information about the degradation pathways and chemicals that are formed by degradation of the six plastic types that are most widely used in Europe. We extrapolate that information to likely pathways and possible degradation products under environmental conditions found on the oceans' surface. The potential degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type. {UV}-radiation and oxygen are the most important factors that initiate degradation of polymers with a carbon–carbon backbone, leading to chain scission. Smaller polymer fragments formed by chain scission are more susceptible to biodegradation and therefore abiotic degradation is expected to precede biodegradation. When heteroatoms are present in the main chain of a polymer, degradation proceeds by photo-oxidation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. Degradation of plastic polymers can lead to low molecular weight polymer fragments, like monomers and oligomers, and formation of new end groups, especially carboxylic acids.},

Successful invaders must resist both physical and physiological stresses associated with the changing environment. A common littoral barnacle, Chthamalus challengeri Hoek, 1883 (Crustacea, Cirripedia), which is native to Japan, South Korea and northern China, has become established in the high-littoral zone adjacent to Yangshan Port, Shanghai, China. A comparison of the morphology of Chthamlus species from Zhoushan archipelago with previous description indicates the occurrence of C. challengeri. The new immigrant becomes a dominant species in certain high-intertidal habitats of the adjacent area to of Yangshan Port. C. challengeri was found in part of sampling sites in Zhoushan in 2010; however, it dispersed to all the eleven sampling sites in 2012. Densities of C.challengeri had increased over 10 times in the last 2 years, with the highest mean value reaching 39533 ± 6243 ind. m−2 in the new habitat. The specific ratios of both operculum area (Sa) to base area ({SA}) and average height of parietal plates (H) to length of base (L) revealed that C. challengeri displays morphological changes to resist stronger currents in the new habitats for invasion.},

	abstract = {How do biogeographically different provinces arise in response to oceanic barriers to dispersal? Here, we analyse how traits related to the pelagic dispersal and adult biology of 985 tropical reef fish species correlate with their establishing populations on both sides of two Atlantic marine barriers: the Mid-Atlantic Barrier ({MAB}) and the Amazon–Orinoco Plume ({AOP}). Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicate that predictors for successful barrier crossing are the ability to raft with flotsam for the deep-water {MAB}, non-reef habitat usage for the freshwater and sediment-rich {AOP}, and large adult-size and large latitudinal-range for both barriers. Variation in larval-development mode, often thought to be broadly related to larval-dispersal potential, is not a significant predictor in either case. Many more species of greater taxonomic diversity cross the {AOP} than the {MAB}. Rafters readily cross both barriers but represent a much smaller proportion of {AOP} crossers than {MAB} crossers. Successful establishment after crossing both barriers may be facilitated by broad environmental tolerance associated with large body size and wide latitudinal-range. These results highlight the need to look beyond larval-dispersal potential and assess adult-biology traits when assessing determinants of successful movements across marine barriers.},

Particles were mostly fragments less than 10 mm in size with nearly all lighter than 0.05 g. Material densities ranged from 0.808 to 1.24 g {mlÀ}1, with about half between 0.97 and 1.04 g {mlÀ}1, a range not typically found in virgin plastics. Elemental analysis suggests that samples in this density range are consistent with polypropylene and polyethylene whose densities have increased, likely due to biofouling. Pelagic densities varied considerably from that of beach plastic debris, suggesting that plastic particles are modiﬁed during their residence at sea. These analyses provide clues in understanding particle fate and potential debris sources, and address ecological implications of pelagic plastic debris.},

This study describes the use of plastic pellets as an oviposition site for Halobates micans and discusses possible effects on its abundance and dispersion. Inspection of egg masses on stranded particles on beaches revealed that a mean of 24\% (from 0\% to 62\%) of the pellets bore eggs (mean of 5 and max. of 48 eggs per pellet). Most eggs (63\%) contained embryos, while 37\% were empty egg shells. This shows that even small plastic particles are used as oviposition site by H. micans, and that marine litter may have a positive effect over the abundance and dispersion of this species.},

We found the vast majority of smaller items were below the surface. Only 17.2\% of debris were microplastics ({\textless} 5 mm). Types of anthropogenic debris diﬀered signiﬁcantly between the standing survey and the loading survey.

Multivariate analyses (principal component analysis and redundancy analysis) confirmed strong similarities between islands and a statistically significant seasonal evolution of litter composition and abundance. In summer (the high tourist season), debris contamination expressed as item abundance was double that in the low season and showed a heterogeneous nature associated with beach use. Cigarette butts were the most abundant item, accounting for up to 46\% of the objects observed in the high tourist season. In contrast, plastics related to personal hygiene/medical items were predominant in wintertime (67\%) and natural wood was the most important debris by weight (75\%). In both seasons, litter characteristics suggested a strong relationship with local land-based origins. While beach users were the main source of summer debris, low tourist season litter was primarily attributed to drainage and outfall systems.},

There is an increasing interest in articulating the added values of the creation of artiﬁcial hard bottom habitats through the construction of offshore renewable energy devices, for the beneﬁt of ﬁsheries management and conservation. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located about 100 km north of Gothenburg at the Swedish west coast. A wave energy device consists of a linear wave power generator attached to a foundation on the seabed, and connected by a wire to a buoy at the surface. Our ﬁeld experiment examined the function of wave energy foundations as artiﬁcial reefs. In addition, potentials for enhancing the abundance of associated ﬁsh and crustaceans through manufactured holes of the foundations were also investigated. Assemblages of mobile organisms were examined by visual censuses in July and August 2007, 3 months after deployment of the foundations. Results generally show low densities of mobile organisms, but a signiﬁcantly higher abundance of ﬁsh and crabs on the foundations compared to surrounding soft bottoms. Further, while ﬁsh numbers were not inﬂuenced by increased habitat complexity (holes), it had a signiﬁcantly positive effect on quantities of edible crab (Cancer pagurus), on average leading to an almost ﬁve-fold increase in densities of this species. Densities of spiny starﬁsh (Marthasterias glacialis) were negatively affected by the presence of holes, potentially due to increased predator abundance (e.g. C. pagurus). These results suggest a species-speciﬁc response to enhanced habitat complexity.},

Participants also enumerated a list of gaps that include, identiﬁcation of indicator organisms of plastic contamination, selection of biomarkers and the role of extreme events on plastic dynamics. Responding to these gaps will contribute to improve data quantity and quality and, thus, allow developing more reliable models.

Unfortunately, the joint empirical evaluation of both is still a challenge. Here, we analyze community similarity in ecological systems in order to evaluate the extent to which indices based exclusively on species composition differ from those that incorporate species interactions. Borrowing tools from graph theory, we compared the classic Jaccard index with the graph edit distance ({GED}), a metric that allowed us to combine species composition and interactions. We found that similarity measures computed using only taxonomic composition could differ strongly from those that include composition and interactions. We conclude that new indices that incorporate community features beyond composition will be more robust for assessing similitude between natural systems than those purely based on species occurrences. Our results have therefore important conceptual and practical consequences for the analysis of ecological communities.},

	abstract = {The introduction of invasive species may be the most profound modern threat to biological communities in high-latitude regions. In the Southern Ocean, the natural transport mechanism for shallowwater marine organisms provided by kelp rafts is being increasingly augmented by plastic debris and shipping activity. Plastic debris provide additional opportunities for dispersal of invasive organisms, but dispersal routes are passive, dependent on ocean currents, and already established. In contrast, ships create novel pathways, moving across currents and often visiting many locations over short periods of time. Transportation of hull-fouling communities by vessel traffic thus poses the most likely mechanism by which exotic species may be introduced to the Southern Ocean.},

While biofouling on marine energy conversion devices on one hand has the potential to be an engineering concern, these structures can also affect biodiversity by functioning as artiﬁcial reefs. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located at the Swedish west coast. Here, buoys acting as point absorbers on the surface are connected to generators anchored on concrete foundations on the seabed. In this study we investigated the colonisation of foundations by invertebrates and ﬁsh, as well as fouling assemblages on buoys. We examined the inﬂuence of surface orientation of the wave power foundations on epibenthic colonisation, and made observations of habitat use by ﬁsh and crustaceans during three years of submergence. We also examined fouling assemblages on buoys and calculated the effects of biofouling on the energy absorption of the wave power buoys. On foundations we demonstrated a succession in colonisation over time with a higher degree of coverage on vertical surfaces. Buoys were dominated by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Calculations indicated that biofouling have no signiﬁcant effect in the energy absorption on a buoy working as a point absorber. This study is the ﬁrst structured investigation on marine organisms associated with wave power devices.},

Coatings tested included Pettit \#1863 and \#1792, West Marine \#11046620, \#5566252 and \#10175206, Hempel Hard Racing \#76484, Hempel Olympic \#86950, Hempasil X3 and International {YBA}920. All coatings were applied on clean plastic slides. Slides without any coating were used as controls. Microbial biofilms were harvested after 2, 7 and 14 days of biofouling. Bacterial density was estimated using epifluorescence microscopy. There was a significant difference between the various treatments (coatings and control) after 2, 7 and 14 days of biofouling. Although there were significant differences between both locations after 2 and 14 days of biofouling, no significant difference was observed after 7 days of biofouling at both locations. At Shangri La, the lowest bacterial density was found on International {YBA}920, Pettit \#1792 and Hempasil X3 after 2 days, 7 days and 14 days respectively in comparison to the control treatments. However at Bandar Rowdha, International {YBA}920 showed the lowest bacterial density after 2 days while West Marine \#10175206 showed the lowest bacterial density after both 7 days and 14 days of biofouling in comparison to the control treatment. The differential performance of tested antifouling coatings may be attributed to several factors including varying environmental conditions, difference in microfouling communities, time of exposure and physical and chemical properties of antifouling coating.},

In the Mexican Caribbean, these events have prompted the study of diverse biological and ecological aspects of these macroalgae.

The occurrence and percent cover of hydroids on Sargassum thalli collected on the beach at Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico from April 2018 to March 2019 was studied. Three pelagic species and morphotypes of Sargassum from this area were analyzed: Sargassum ﬂuitans {III}, S. natans I and S. natans {VIII}, as well as a benthic species, S. polyceratium var. ovatum. A total of 14 taxa of hydroids, belonging to the superorders “Anthoathecata” and Leptothecata, were identiﬁed. In our study, more hydroid taxa were observed on axes of the different species of Sargassum than on leaves or aerocysts. In general, the greatest species richness of hydroids was observed from February to April. Results show that live hydrozoans attached to pelagic Sargassum are transported into the area. This should be considered in future management measures that address the recurring coastal abundance of Sargassum and its associated biota in the Caribbean region.},

Statistical analysis show that the mean abundance differed between surveys, generally ranging from 26 ± 68 to 80 ± 133 kg/km2. A typology of {SMD} indicates that plastic represented 73\% of the debris collected, followed by rubber (12\%), textile (8\%), metal (3\%), glass (0.32\%), and some unidentified materials (2.70\%). Analysis of results shows that the abundance and the distribution of {SMD} were strongly influenced by the local anthropogenic activities and by rivers inputs. The movements and accumulations in the open sea were also shown to be influenced by the geomorphology and the hydrodynamics of the basin.},

Satellite-tracked drifters and numerical models are an important source of information relevant to transport processes as well as distribution patterns of ﬂoating marine litter ({FML}) on a regional to global scale. Sub-mesoscale processes in coastal and estuarine systems have an enormous impact on pathways and accumulation zones of {FML} and are yet to be fully understood. Here we present a state-of-the-art, low-cost and robust design of a satellite-tracked drifter applicable in studying complex pathways and sub-mesoscale dynamics of ﬂoating litter in tidally inﬂuenced coastal and estuarine systems. It is compact, lightweight {\textless}5 kg, capable of reﬂoating, easily recovered and modiﬁed. The drifter motion resolves currents of the ocean surface layer (top 0.5 m layer) taking into account wind induced motions. We further showcase ﬁndings from seven of our custom-made drifters deployed from {RV} Heincke and {RV} Senckenberg in the German Bight during spring and autumn 2017. Drifter velocities were computed from high resolved drifter position data and compared to local wind ﬁeld observations. It was noted that the net transport of the drifters in areas far away from the coast was dominated by wind-driven surface currents, 1\% of the wind speed, whereas the transport pattern in coastal areas was mainly overshadowed by local small-scale processes like tidal jet currents, interactions with a complex shoreline and fronts generated by riverine freshwater plumes.},

They are known to be suitable substrates for supporting the development of highly complex ﬁsh and zoobenthic communities. However, these areas are threatened by local ﬁshing, due to their peculiar morphology and topography which promote gear entanglement. With the aims of quantifying the impacts of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded ﬁshing gear ({ALDFG}) on these rocky habitats and monitoring the biodiversity recovery after {ALDFG} removal, acoustic and diving surveys were performed to map 15 selected rocky outcrops and one artiﬁcial reef (for a total surface area of 21 km2). The recovery capability of benthic and ﬁsh communities was evaluated by non-destructive techniques in 5 outcrops periodically sampled throughout 18 months. The data collected (number of individuals, species, taxa, and coverage per each species and taxon) were used to calculate three biodiversity indices (species richness, Margalef and Shannon indices) and to assess community recovery. Mapping activities veriﬁed the occurrence of 347 {ALDFG} distributed unevenly over half of the investigated rocky outcrops. The following cleaning operations led to the removal of 362 items, for a total dry weight of 514 kg. The study on biodiversity recovery showed that the complexity of benthic communities gradually improved. In particular, the various biodiversity indices evaluated at the end of the monitoring period generally showed values comparable, or even higher, than those recorded in the reference sites. An increase in biodiversity and species abundance was also observed for ﬁsh community; in particular, cryptic species were able to occupy cracks and fractures of rocks previously obstructed by the derelict ﬁshing gear.},

The data were collected in a scientiﬁc trawl survey carried out from 5 to 25 October 2014 between (26N) to (21N) covering diﬀerent stratums of depths (from 10 to 266 m) and following a sampling network of 100 stations distributed randomly in the study area. A total of 603 kg of debris was collected and sorted into ﬁve main categories: plastic, metal, rubber, textiles and glass. Over 50\% of collected items was made by plastic, 94\% of them are the plastic ﬁshing gear used to capture the Octopus vulgaris. The analysis of the distribution shows that anthropogenic debris is present in the majority of the prospected area (∼ 47,541 km2) with diﬀerent densities ranging from 0 to 1768 ( ± 298,15) kg/km2. The spatial autocorrelation approach using {GIS} shows that the concentration of this debris is correlated very well with a set of factors such as the proximity to ﬁshing activity sites.

To gain additional insights, ﬁve types of {PD} (polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyurethane) were exposed for three-time periods (two weeks, four weeks, and six weeks) in the Haihe Estuary. 16S {rRNA} gene sequencing was used to identify the bacterial communities on {PD}, in seawater, and in sediment samples. The results indicate that the average growth rate of a bioﬁlm is aﬀected by nutrients (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) and salinity. Furthermore, salinity is the primary factor aﬀecting bacterial diversity of the colonies on {PD}. In addition, genera of bacteria show selectivity toward the {PD} polymer type and tend to colonize their preferred substrate. Compared with seawater and sediment, {PD} could be carriers for enrichment of Vibrio in the estuarine environment with salinity ≥26 (± 2‰), which might increase the ecological risk of {PD} in marine environments.},

Here, we report the results of an analysis of seabed images to investigate species composition, behavior, spatial distribution and preferred habitats of demersal fish assemblages in the southern Weddell Sea. Our study was based on a total of 2736 high-resolution images, covering a total seabed area of 11,317 m2, which were taken at 13 stations at water depths between 200 and 750 m. Fish were found in 380 images. A total of 379 notothenioid specimens were recorded, representing four families (Nototheniidae, Artedidraconidae, Bathydraconidae, Channichthyidae), 17 genera and 25 species. Nototheniidae was the most speciose family, including benthic species (Trematomus spp.) and the pelagic species Pleuragramma antarctica, which was occasionally recorded in dense shoals. Bathydraconids ranked second with six species, followed by artedidraconids and channichthyids, both with five species. Most abundant species were Trematomus scotti and T. lepidorhinus among nototheniids, and Dolloidraco longedorsalis and Pagetopsis maculatus among artedidraconids and channichthyids, respectively. Both T. lepidorhinus and P. maculatus preferred seabed habitats characterized by biogenous debris and rich epibenthic fauna, whereas T. scotti and D. longedorsalis were frequently seen resting on fine sediments and scattered gravel. Several fish species were recorded to make use of the three-dimensional structure formed by epibenthic foundation species, like sponges, for perching or hiding inside. Nesting behavior was observed, frequently in association with dropstones, in species from various families, including Channichthyidae (Chaenodraco wilsoni and Pagetopsis macropterus) and Bathydraconidae (Cygnodraco mawsoni).},

From these data we deﬁned an accumulation zone (25 to 41°N, 130 to 180°W) in the North Paciﬁc subtropical gyre that closely corresponds to centers of accumulation resulting from the convergence of ocean surface currents predicted by several oceanographic numerical models. Maximum plastic concentrations from individual surface net tows exceeded 106 pieces km−2, with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the predicted center of accumulation. Outside the North Paciﬁc subtropical gyre the median plastic concentration was 0 pieces km−2. We were unable to detect a robust temporal trend in the data set, perhaps because of confounded spatial and temporal variability. Large spatiotemporal variability in plastic concentration causes order of magnitude diﬀerences in summary statistics calculated over short time periods or in limited geographic areas. Utilizing all available plankton net data collected in the eastern Paciﬁc Ocean (17.4°S to 61.0°N; 85.0 to 180.0°W) since 1999, we estimated a minimum of 21 290 t of ﬂoating microplastic.},

A total of 42 fragments of plastic were collected during the {COMSOM} experimental cruise, 16 from the seafloor and 26 from surface waters. The results showed that diatoms were the most abundant organisms on both pelagic and benthic plastics. The diatom Ceratoneis closterium, frequently observed on surface plastics (73\%), is a harmful microalgae associated with mucilage events in the Mediterranean. The abundance of marine plastic in coastal and oceanic waters may provide new habitats that offer an easy substrate for these invasive organisms. Furthermore, the colonization of these new environments might reduce the success of life strategies, or drive the organisms out of their essential habitat by dispersion and rafting phenomena. The results of the present work highlight the need to increase our knowledge of the consequences of colonization of plastics introduced into the marine environment, and the need to raise awareness of the potential impacts of debris accumulation on biodiversity of marine ecosystems.},

However, as one of the major coastal interfaces they are subject to plastic pollution, one of the most signiﬁcant global environmental threats at present. For the ﬁrst time for Uruguayan beaches, this study assessed and quantiﬁed the accumulation of plastic and microplastic debris on sandy beaches of the major touristic destination Punta del Este during the austral spring of 2013. Aiming to provide valuable information for decision-making, we performed a detailed analysis of plastic debris, their eventual transport pathways to the coast (from land and sea), and the associated persistent pollutants. The results indicated that the smallest size fractions ({\textless}20 mm) were the dominant size range, with fragments and resin pellets as types with the highest number of items. {PAHs} and {PCBs} were found in plastic debris, and their levels did not differ from baseline values reported for similar locations. The abundance of plastic debris was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated with both the presence of possible land-based sources (e.g. storm-water drains, beach bars, beach access, car parking, and roads), and dissipative beach conditions. The analysis of coastal currents suggested some potential deposition areas along Punta del Este, and particularly for resin pellets, although modeling was not conclusive. From a local management point of view, the development and use of indices that allow predicting trends in the accumulation of plastic debris would be critically useful. The time dimension (e.g. seasonal) should also be considered for this threat, being crucial for locations such as Uruguay, where the use of beaches increases signiﬁcantly during the summer. This ﬁrst diagnosis aims to generate scientiﬁc baseline, necessary for improved management of plastic litter on beaches and their watersheds.},

              The accumulation of microplastics (plastic particles less than 5 mm) and similarly sized small anthropogenic litter ({SAL};
              e.g.
              , cellulosic products manufactured from natural material) in aquatic ecosystems is a growing concern. These particles can serve as vectors of chemical toxins and microbial pathogens and thus, as organisms consume them, may lead to biomagnification of these contaminants. As collection points in managed water systems, wastewater treatment plants ({WWTPs}) provide an opportunity to develop and implement novel technologies to manage {SAL} pollution. Here, we assessed the efficiency of different unit processes at three {WWTPs} in removing {SAL}. Samples were collected from {WWTPs} that employ either secondary treatment (activated sludge) or tertiary treatment (granular sand filtration) as a final step, as well as a pilot membrane bioreactor system that finishes treatment with microfiltration. {SAL} from 20 μm to 4.75 mm was quantified and categorized by shape. The {WWTP} with secondary treatment removed 95.6\% of {SAL}, discharging 5.9 {SAL} per L in the final effluent; the plant with tertiary treatment removed 97.2\% of {SAL}, discharging 2.6 {SAL} per L; the membrane bioreactor plant removed 99.4\% of {SAL}, discharging 0.5 {SAL} per L. The majority of {SAL} in effluent from all plants was comprised of thin fibers (
              e.g.
              , textile fibers). While the {WWTP} with tertiary granular sand filtration and the membrane bioreactor exhibited greater overall removal of {SAL}, fibers represented a larger percentage of {SAL} in effluent from these plants (79 and 83\%, respectively) than the plant with activated sludge as a final step (44\% fibers). This study suggests that retrofitting existing secondary {WWTPs} with granular sand filtration or membrane filtration would result in the highest possible removal of {SAL}—though treatment facilities would continue to serve as pathways of {SAL} pollution to the environment. Further, the fate of the 95–99\% of {SAL} that is retained or leaves {WWTPs} through means other than effluent (
              e.g.
              , sludge) must be resolved to effectively address this problem.},

The relative size and concentration of each clearly illustrate the dominance of the accumulation zones in the northern hemisphere, while smaller seas surrounded by densely populated areas are also shown to have a high concentration of ﬂoating debris. We also determine the relative contribution of different source regions to the total amount of material in a particular accumulation zone.

	abstract = {Plastics contamination in the marine environment was ﬁrst reported nearly 50 years ago, less than two decades after the rise of commercial plastics production, when less than 50 million metric tons were produced per year. In 2014, global plastics production surpassed 300 million metric tons per year. Plastic debris has been detected worldwide in all major marine habitats, in sizes from microns to meters. In response, concerns about risks to marine wildlife upon exposure to the varied forms of plastic debris have increased, stimulating new research into the extent and consequences of plastics contamination in the marine environment. Here, I present a framework to evaluate the current understanding of the sources, distribution, fate, and impacts of marine plastics. Despite remaining knowledge gaps in mass budgeting and challenges in investigating ecological impacts, the increasing evidence of the ubiquity of plastics contamination in the marine environment, the continued rapid growth in plastics production, and the evidence—albeit limited—of demonstrated impacts to marine wildlife support immediate implementation of source-reducing measures to decrease the potential risks of plastics in the marine ecosystem.},

Litter was dominated by plastics throughout the study area, but the proportion of plastics was higher at sea and on the oceanic islands than in coastal waters and on continental beaches. Litter densities were higher close to the center of the {SP} subtropical gyre compared to the continental coast. The seabird assemblage was diverse (28 species), and several endemic species were recorded. Seabird abundances were higher in the coastal waters and around Juan Fernández Islands off the continental coast than in the Oceanic and Polynesian sectors. Endangered species breeding on Salas \& Gómez Island were observed in the Polynesian sector, which suggests a high potential for negative interactions between seabirds and ﬂoating litter, both occurring in high densities in this sector.},

Relatively large amount of plastics (180–500 kg) were found on less visited barrier island beaches, i.e. Blackbeard, Ossabaw and Cumberland Islands. A follow up monthly or quarterly collection study was carried out on two of the sites, a barrier beach and estuarine marsh, to determine accumulation rate in 8000 m2 areas. Accumulation rates ranged from 0.18 to 1.28 kg/30 days–8000 m2 on the barrier island beach and from 0.6 to 1.61 kg/30 days–8000 m2 at the estuarine marsh site.

Where are the more likely coastal zones impacted from open ocean sources? Multi-annual simulations of advected surface passive debris depict the Tyrrhenian Sea, the north-western Mediterranean sub-basin and the Gulf of Sirte as possible retention areas. The western Mediterranean coasts present very low coastal impact, while the coastal strip from Tunisia to Syria appears as the favourite destination. No permanent structure able to retain ﬂoating items in the long-term were found, as the basin circulation variability brings sufﬁcient anomalies.},

Metabolic activity was analysed by measurements of Electron Transport System ({ETS}] activity and heat production. This, combined with live observations, revealed 2 survival strategies. Ruperlina stabilis, an obligate suspension feeder, is adapted to conditions in which it receives a steady input of particles throughout the year, enabling it to maintain a relatively high {ATP} content (153 f 23 ng {ATP} ind.-l) with a reduced {ATP} turnover rate (0.008S-'). In contrast Cribrostomoides subglobosum, Pyrgo rotalaria and Rhabdammina abyssorum undergo large (up to 10-fold) fluctuations in seasonal values of {ATP} and heat production, but retain a high, relatively constant {ATP} turnover rate (i.e.seconds).Such a rapid turnover allows these foraminifera to take quick advantage of sudden nutrient inputs; this state of readiness, however, is maintained at the cost of the protoplasm, which benthic foraminifera are apparently capable of metabolizing in times of starvation. C. subglobosum and P rotalaria responded to several sedimentation events with an increase in {ETS} activ{\textasciitilde}tys;ingle cells sometimes showed extremely high {ATP} values (50- to 100-foldincrease), reflecting an individual physiological response to food input to the deep-sea.},

	abstract = {The ﬂoating plastic debris along the Arabian coast of the Red Sea was sampled by using surface-trawling plankton nets. A total of 120 sampling sites were spread out over the near-shore waters along 1,500 km of coastline during seven cruises performed during 2016 and 2017. Plastic debris, dominated by millimeter-sized pieces, was constituted mostly of fragments of rigid objects (73\%) followed by pieces of ﬁlms (17\%), ﬁshing lines (6\%), and foam (4\%). These fragments were mainly made up by polyethylene (69\%) and polypropylene (21\%). Fibers, likely released from synthetic textiles, were ubiquitous and abundant, although were analyzed independently due to the risk of including non-plastic ﬁbers and airborne contamination of samples in spite of the precautions taken. The plastic concentrations (excluding possible plastic ﬁbers) contrasts with those found in other semi-closed seas, such as the neighboring Mediterranean. They were relatively low all over the Red Sea ({\textless}50,000 items km−2; mean ± {SD} = 3,546 ± 8,154 plastic item km−2, 1.1 ± 3.0 g km−2) showing no clear spatial relationship with the distribution of coastal population. Results suggests a low plastic waste input from land as the most plausible explanation for this relative shortage of plastic in the surface waters of the Red Sea; however, the additional intervention of particular processes of surface plastic removal by ﬁsh or the ﬁltering activity of the extensive coral reefs along the coastline cannot be discarded. In addition, our study highlights the relevance of determining speciﬁc regional conversion rates of mismanaged plastic waste to marine debris, accounting for the role of near-shore activities (e.g., beach tourism, recreational navigation), in order to estimate plastic waste inputs into the ocean.},

Litter was found to be distributed throughout Irish waters with highest occurrences in the Celtic Sea. Over 50\% of litter encountered was attributed to ﬁshing activities: however only a small proportion of the variability in litter occurrence could be explained by spatial patterns in ﬁshing effort.

Anthropogenic debris items were counted and classiﬁed along transects, and the inﬂuence of main drivers of distribution were considered (i.e. land-based and ocean-based sources, density of the forest and properties of the object). We conﬁrmed that distance to major maritime trafﬁc routes signiﬁcantly affects the density of anthropogenic debris in Red Sea mangrove forests, while this was independent of land-based activities. This suggests ocean-based activities combined with surface currents as major drivers of litter in this basin. Additionally, litter was more abundant where the mangrove density was higher, and object distribution through the mangrove stand often depended on their shape and dimension. We particularly show that pneumatophores act as a sieve retaining large plastic objects, leading to higher plastic mass estimates in mangroves compared to those of beaches previously surveyed in the Red Sea.},

	abstract = {The non-indigenous cheilostome bryozoan Fenestrulina delicia Winston, Hayward and Craig has been recorded for the first time in the southern hemisphere. It was found on experimental substrata submersed to study the fouling assemblage of Quequén Harbour (Argentina, southwest Atlantic), an estuarine environment. Its density on experimental panels was very high, reaching almost 5,000 colonies.m−2. The percentage of ovicellate colonies, however, was relatively low (mean±{SD}: 5.2±2.3 \%, range: 1.6 – 9.9 \%) due to the abundance of newly recruited zoaria. F. delicia was originally described for the Atlantic coast of the United States. It was later discovered in Alaska, Oregon and California, and has recently been reported as a highly invasive fouler along the Atlantic coasts of Europe. This species seems to have the potential to continue its dispersion by means of maritime traffic, or rafting on plastic debris, and become a stable component of this and neighbouring harbours in the area.},

Light microscopy demonstrated that the total abundance of diatoms and the relative abundance of growth forms were signiﬁcantly affected by the choice of biocidal antifouling coating and experimental location. Using scanning electron microscopy, a total of 21 diatom genera were identiﬁed which were grouped into adnate, motile, plocon and erect growth forms. The adnate growth forms, mainly the genera Amphora, Cocconeis and Mastogloia, dominated the other growth forms in terms of their relative abundance. Current results revealed the importance of exposure location and choice of biocidal antifouling coating on the relative abundance of diatom growth forms.},

In terms of abundance, microplastics ({\textless}5 mm) accounted for 61\% of debris, showing their wide distribution on Adriatic coasts, even far-away from densely populated areas. The majority of the polymers found were polyoleﬁns: there were greater quantities of polyethylene and polypropylene compared to other types of plastic. Primary microplastics accounted for only 5.6\% of the total plastic debris. There were greater quantities of microplastics at sites subjected to stronger riverine runoff. The results will provide useful background information for further investigations to understand the sink and sources of this emergent and priority contaminant.},

The study assessed the quality and quantity of macrodebris and the quality, size and quantity of microplastics at six beaches, contrasting those under the inﬂuences of tourism and those that were not. Beach cleanliness was estimated using the Clean Coast Index. Tourism did not seem to have an effect on macrodebris or microplastic quantity at beaches. Over 64\% of macrodebris was plastic, and microplastics were ubiquitous, which calls for classiﬁcation of plastics as hazardous materials. Standard measures for marine debris assessment are needed, especially in the form of an all-encompassing debris index. Recommendations for future assessments are provided for the Adriatic region.},

Here, we present results concerning the Polymeric Articles’ abundances registered during the survey. Moreover, we show the results of the first study devoted to describe and quantify the anthropogenic content of the nest of a pair of Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus), a pelagic bird that, starting from some years, has been reproducing regularly in La Spezia Gulf. This breeding is atypical for this species, as is associated with artificial structures such as piers, floating docks, or boats; the material used in the construction of the nest reflects the “anthropogenic” link with the chosen location and objects of polymeric origin in particular abound. We detect the existence of a correlation between the most abundant types of Anthropogenic Marine Debris found in the Northern Gannet’ nest (fragments of polypropylene nets) and one of the productive activities of the zones.},

	abstract = {Bioﬁlms are complex microbial communities with important biological functions including enhanced resistance against external factors like antimicrobial agents. The formation of a bioﬁlm is known to be strongly dependent on substrate properties including hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, structure, and roughness. The adsorption of (macro)molecules on the substrate, also known as conditioning ﬁlm, changes the physicochemical properties of the surface and affects the bacterial adhesion. In this study, we investigate the physicochemical changes caused by Periwinkle wilt ({PW}) culture medium conditioning ﬁlm formation on different surfaces (glass and silicon) and their effect on X. fastidiosa bioﬁlm formation. Contact angle measurements have shown that the ﬁlm formation decreases the surface hydrophilicity degree of both glass and silicon after few hours. Atomic force microscopy ({AFM}) images show the glass surface roughness is drastically reduced with conditioning ﬁlm formation. First-layer X. fastidiosa bioﬁlm on glass was observed in the {AFM} liquid cell after a period of time similar to that determined for the hydrophilicity changes. In addition, attenuation total reﬂection–Fourier transform infrared ({ATR}-{FTIR}) spectroscopy supports the {AFM} observation, since the {PW} absorption spectra increases with time showing a stronger contribution from the phosphate groups. Although hydrophobic and rough surfaces are commonly considered to increase bacteria cell attachment, our results suggest that these properties are not as important as the surface functional groups resulting from {PW} conditioning ﬁlm formation for X. fastidiosa adhesion and bioﬁlm development.},

Substrate- and location-specific effects were investigated by comparing the microbial communities developed on polyethylene terephthalate ({PET}) and polyethylene ({PE}) with those on steel and wood, at two locations in the Sea of Oman. Total biomass was lower on {PET} and {PE} than on steel and wood. {PET} had the highest bacterial abundance at both locations, whereas chlorophyll a concentrations did not vary between substrates. {MiSeq} 16S ribosomal {RNA} sequencing revealed comparable operational taxonomic unit ({OTU}) richness on all substrates at one location but lower numbers on {PET} and {PE} at the other location. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ({NMDS}) showed distinct clusters of the bacterial communities based on substrate (analysis of similarity ({ANOSIM}), R = 0.45–0.97, p {\textless} 0.03) and location ({ANOSIM}, R = 0.56, p {\textless} 0.0001). The bacterial genera Microcystis and Hydrogenophaga and the diatoms Licmophora and Mastogloia were specifically detected on plastics. Desulfovibrio and Pseudomonas spp. exhibited their highest abundance on steel and Corynebacterium spp. on wood. Scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) revealed fissure formation on {PET} and {PE}, indicating physical degradation. The presence of free radicals on {PET} and carbonyl bonds (C=O) on {PE}, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared ({FTIR}) spectroscopy, indicated abiotic degradation while hydroxyl groups and spectral peaks for proteins and polysaccharides on {PE} indicated biotic degradation. We conclude that fouling microbial communities are not only substrate-specific but also location-specific and microbes developing on plastics could potentially contribute to their degradation in the marine environment.},

This result suggests that household needs give the big proportion of debris such as Food wrapper, cigarettes butts, and foam pieces. In addition, the study indicates that there is a strong relation between human activities and spreading of debris.},

	abstract = {Plastics are common and pervasive anthropogenic debris in marine environments. Floating plastics provide opportunities to alter the abundance, distribution and invasion potential of sessile organisms that colonize them. We selected plastics from seven recycle categories and quantiﬁed settlement of (i) bryozoans Bugula neritina (Linnaeus, 1758) in the lab and in the ﬁeld, and of (ii) barnacles Amphibalanus (¼ Balanus) amphitrite (Darwin, 1854) in the ﬁeld. In the laboratory we cultured barnacles on the plastics for 8 weeks and quantiﬁed growth, mortality, and breaking strength of the side plates. In the ﬁeld all recyclable plastics were settlement substrata for bryozoans and barnacles. Settlement depended on the type of plastic. Fewer barnacles settled on plastic surfaces compared to glass. In the lab and in the ﬁeld, bryozoan settlement was higher on plastics than on glass. In static laboratory rearing, barnacles growing on plastics were initially signiﬁcantly smaller than on glass. This suggested juvenile barnacles were adversely impacted by materials leaching from the plastics. Barnacle mortality was not signiﬁcantly different between plastic and glass surfaces, but breaking strength of side plates of barnacles on polyvinyl chloride ({PVC}) and polycarbonate ({PC}) were signiﬁcantly lower than breakage strength on glass. Plastics impact marine ecosystems directly by providing new surfaces for colonization with fouling organisms and by contaminants shown previously to leach out of plastics and impact biological processes.},

Litter was most abundant at sites closest to the coastline and population centres, suggesting the majority of the litter was land sourced. Plastic was the dominant type of debris, followed by ﬁshing gear. Standardised mean abundance was 1100 litter items {kmÀ}2, but was as high as 6600 litter items {kmÀ}2 in canyons close to Lisbon. Although all anthropogenic material may be harmful to biota, debris was also used as a habitat by some macro-invertebrates. Litter composition and abundance observed in the canyons of the Portuguese margin were comparable to those seen in other deep sea areas around the world. Accumulation of litter in the deep sea is a consequence of human activities both on land and at sea. This needs to be taken into account in future policy decisions regarding marine pollution.},

Plastic dominated in terms of abundance, followed by paper and other groups. The average density was 0.2 litter items {mÀ}2, but at one beach it raised to 0.57 items {mÀ}2. The major categories were cigarette butts, unrecognizable plastic pieces, bottle caps, and others. The majority of marine litter came from land-based sources: shoreline and recreational activities, smoke-related activities and dumping. Sea-based sources contributed for less. The abundance and distribution of litter seemed to be particularly inﬂuenced by beach users, reﬂecting inadequate disposal practices.

	abstract = {Forty-nine species of Western Pacific coastal bryozoans were found on 317 objects (originating from the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011) that drifted across the North Pacific Ocean and landed in the Hawaiian Islands and North America. The most common species were Scruparia ambigua (d’Orbigny, 1841) and Callaetea sp. Of 36 bryozoans identified to species level, 15 are already known from North America, one of which (Schizoporella japonica Ortmann, 1890) is an earlier introduction from Japan; 18 species are known only from the Western Pacific, one of which (Bugula tsunamiensis {McCuller}, Carlton and Geller, 2018) is newly described in a companion paper. The 13 additional bryozoans, not taken to species level, are likely derived from the Western Pacific based upon evidence reviewed here; two of these species (Callaetea sp. and Arbocuspis sp.) are undescribed. Seven warm-water species, Metroperiella cf. biformis (Zhang and Liu, 1995), Celleporaria brunnea (Hincks, 1884), Drepanophora cf. gutta Tilbrook, Hayward and Gordon, 2001, Smittoidea spinigera (Liu, 1990), Biflustra grandicella (Canu and Bassler, 1929), Biflustra irregulata (Liu, 1991), and Celleporina cf. globosa Liu, 2001, not known from Japan, may have been acquired by Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris ({JTMD}) as these objects were carried by ocean currents into more southern waters. Three oceanic bryozoans (Jellyella tuberculata (Bosc, 1802), Jellyella eburnea (Hincks, 1891), and Arbopercula angulata (Levinsen, 1909)) provide insight into the routes that some {JTMD} items may have taken, and thus the conditions experienced, as they rafted from the Western Pacific to the Central and Eastern Pacific. The cooler-water species J. tuberculata and A. angulata were found primarily on {JTMD} objects arriving in the Pacific Northwest, whereas J. eburnea was most common on objects landing in the Hawaiian Islands. The most common bryozoan growth forms on these rafted objects were runners (creeping uniserial morphology) and arborescent forms capable of using available surface area provided by other organisms (such as hydroids) on space-limited objects. Species that form flat or mounded encrustations were less frequent, suggesting that they do not fare as well in a potentially space-limited environment.},

	abstract = {Due to their small size, planktonic marine microorganisms have large dispersal capacity in the global ocean. However, it is not known how epibenthic microalgae disperse across long distances because they are generally associated with a substrate. In this study, we examined a long-term data series ({\textasciitilde}50 yr) of microalgal composition from a coastal station in southeast Australia for the presence of epibenthic dinoflagellates in the plankton. In addition, we collected drifting macrophytes (i.e. macroalgae and seagrass) and plastic debris from the East Australian Current, identified the associated microalgal assemblage, assessed their viability, and used phylogenetic analyses to taxonomically identify cryptic harmful epibenthic dinoflagellate species. We found no occurrences of epibenthic dinoflagellates from the genera Gambierdiscus, Fukuyoa, Ostreopsis, and Coolia at the long-term coastal station, concluding that entrainment of cells in ocean currents is an unlikely mechanism for transport of these taxa. The epibenthic microalgal communities associated with macrophyte rafts and plastic debris were primarily comprised of diatom taxa. However, intact cells of potentially harmful epibenthic dinoflagellates from the genera Coolia, Amphidinium, and Prorocentrum were also observed, and their viability was confirmed by division of isolated cells and establishment into clonal cultures. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of C. palmyrensis on a drifting Sargassum sp. raft, the first report of this potentially harmful epibenthic species in temperate Australian waters. This study shows that epibenthic dinoflagellates can attach to, and remain viable, when associated with macrophyte fragments that drift in the open ocean, therefore revealing rafting as a potential vector for dispersal of these organisms.},

We compared the prevalence and composition of debris in nests and along the beach at two Brown Booby (Sula leucogaster) colonies on Ashmore Reef, Timor Sea, a remote area known to contain high densities of debris transported by ocean currents. The proportion of nests with debris varied across islands (range 3–31\%), likely in response to the availability of natural nesting materials. Boobies exhibited a preference for debris colour (white and black), but not type. The ephemeral nature of Brown Booby nests on Ashmore Reef may limit their utility as indicators of marine pollution, however monitoring is recommended in light of increasing demand for plastic products.},

	abstract = {The Red Sea holds one of the lowest concentrations of ﬂoating plastic worldwide and no evident congregation zones were identiﬁed so far, despite peculiar oceanographic features that candidate the basin as an accumulation area for ﬂoating debris. However, the Red Sea exhibits a complex pattern of surface currents, which changes according to the monsoon season, possibly affecting the abundance of plastic throughout the year. To explore the effect of seasonality on plastic concentration in surface waters, we conducted a fortnightly time series sampling, using a neuston net, for 21 months at a pelagic station in the central Red Sea, where the major seasonal overturn of the Red Sea surface circulation occurs. The estimated average abundance (±{SE}) was 58,563 ± 19,272 items Km−2 (73.5 ± 40.75 g Km−2), highly variable according to season, lower during the summer monsoon. Indeed, the winter monsoon pushes oceanic surface waters inside the Red Sea, transporting alongside ﬂoating plastic items, whilst surface currents exit the basin during the summer monsoon, depleting central Red Sea waters from ﬂoating plastic. Composition of plastic items also changes through time. Particularly, the higher proportion of ﬁlms and foams during summer months suggests that the main source of plastic at the sampling station from June to September is a short-range transport, while during winter months, the higher contribution of small fragments indicates that, from October to May, plastic is also transported to the central Red Sea through surface currents for long distances, possibly coming all the way from the Indian Ocean.},

Here we have challenged the idea of using the abundance of marine litter present in a zone to estimate the risk of {NIS} introduction. To test this, a targeted sampling of plastic bottles and ﬁshing gear (ropes and nets) was performed along 22 beaches from the Cantabrian coast where ports have been reported as a source of biological invasions. All items with attached organisms were collected and recorded. Genetic barcoding was used to ascertain the species and identify {NIS}. In total 17 species attached to plastic bottles and ﬁshing gears were identiﬁed. Three of them, found on the two types of items, are catalogued as invasive species: Austrominius modestus; Magallana gigas; and, Amphibalanus amphitrite. Prevalence and mean intensity of non-indigenous biota on plastic bottles and ﬁshing gear were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The abundance of barnacles in litter was signiﬁcantly correlated with that found from ports in the same region. The results suggest that ropes are able to transport diﬀerent marine organisms and {NIS} as plastic bottles do. Monitoring biota on marine litter could serve as an additional tool for {NIS} detection.},

As expected, the beaches closest to Salvador presented the largest density of debris, with the exception of the Porto da Barra beach, which has an efﬁcient public cleaning system and does not have any vegetation, making it difﬁcult to accumulate solid waste. Linear regression analyses showed signiﬁcant relationships between the distance from the urban center (Salvador) and the number of marine debris per m2, the total number of debris per beach (abundance), and the diversity of debris types (richness).

While it is known that the problem of marine litter may be affected by waste management practices on land, beach survey results have seldom been compared with them. In this study, marine litter surveys on four beaches of Cijin Island were conducted to explore the effects of waste management and policy implications. Indirect evidence shows that chances for land-based litter, such as plastic bags and bottles, entering the marine environment can be greatly decreased if they can be properly reduced, reused and recycled. We suggest that mitigation measures should focus on source reduction, waste recycling and management, utilizing effective economic instruments, and pursuing a long-term public education campaign to raise the public awareness of this problem.},

Marine litter densities amounted to 43 ± 33 kg km−2 and 74 ± 28 items km−2, with plastics and ﬁsheries derived litter being the most widespread categories. Litter densities generally decreased along the water depth axis. To identify possible drivers for the observed litter distribution we performed a generalised additive model, which explained 14.8\% of the variance and pointed to densely populated areas, number of ﬁshing ports, geographical sector and ﬁshing activity as the main explanatory factors. The most important driver for the benthic litter distribution was human population, as litter density linearly increased along this variable. Similarly, the number of ports in neighbouring areas had a positive eﬀect on litter densities. Fishing eﬀort had a negative and non-linear eﬀect on benthic litter density which could be explained by litter delocalization during ﬁshing operations. We hypothesise that litter might accumulate preferentially on the periphery of rocky bottoms, out of reach for our sampling methodology. Litter distribution diﬀered among geographical sectors, pointing to other variables such as shipping traﬃc and oceanographic currents, which were not explicitly considered in the analysis. Our study sets a reference level for benthic macrolitter in the southern Bay of Biscay and identiﬁes factors driving its distribution, which can be extrapolated to other continental shelf seas. Our ﬁndings lay the foundations to develop measures aiming to reduce macro-litter densities on the seaﬂoor.},

However, the dynamics of the biodegradation of plastic in marine environments have not yet been elucidated in detail. Polyhydroxyalkanoates ({PHAs}) are biodegradable polymers that are synthesized by a wide range of microorganisms. One of the {PHA} derivatives, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) ({PHBH}) has flexible material properties and a low melting temperature. After an incubation in seawater samples, a significant amount of biofilms were observed on the surfaces of {PHBH} films, and some {PHBH} films were mostly or partially degraded. In the biofilms that formed on the surfaces of unbroken {PHBH} films, the most dominant operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) showed high similarity with the genus Glaciecola in the family Alteromonadaceae. On the other hand, the dominant {OTUs} in the biofilms that formed on the surfaces of broken {PHBH} films were assigned to the families Rhodobacteraceae, Rhodospirillaceae, and Oceanospirillaceae, and the genus Glaciecola mostly disappeared. The bacterial community in the biofilms on {PHBH} films was assumed to have dynamically changed according to the progression of degradation. Approximately 50 colonies were isolated from the biofilm samples that formed on the {PHBH} films and their {PHBH}-degrading activities were assessed. Two out of three {PHBH}-degrading isolates showed high similarities to Glaciecola lipolytica and Aestuariibacter halophilus in the family Alteromonadaceae. These results suggest that bacterial strains belonging to the family Alteromonadaceae function as the principal {PHBH}-degrading bacteria in these biofilms.},

Due to its resistance to degradation, most plastic debris will persist in the environment for centuries and may be transported far from its source, including great distances out to sea. Land- and ocean-based sources are the major sources of plastic entering the environment, with domestic, industrial and ﬁshing activities being the most important contributors. Ocean gyres are particular hotspots of plastic waste accumulation. Both macroplastics and microplastics pose a risk to organisms in the natural environment, for example, through ingestion or entanglement in the plastic. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants, which can then bioaccumulate in the food chain, from plastic waste by organisms. To address the issue of plastic pollution in the marine environment, governments should ﬁrst play an active role in addressing the issue of plastic waste by introducing legislation to control the sources of plastic debris and the use of plastic additives. In addition, plastics industries should take responsibility for the end-of-life of their products by introducing plastic recycling or upgrading programmes.},

	abstract = {Population differentiation and diversification depend in large part on the ability and propensity of organisms to successfully disperse. However, our understanding of these processes in organisms with high dispersal ability is biased by the limited genetic resolution offered by traditional genotypic markers. Many neustonic animals disperse not only as pelagic larvae, but also as juveniles and adults while drifting or rafting at the surface of the open ocean. In theory, the heightened dispersal ability of these animals should limit opportunities for species diversification and population differentiation. To test these predictions, we used next‐generation sequencing of genomewide restriction‐site‐associated {DNA} tags ({RADseq}) and traditional mitochondrial {DNA} sequencing, to investigate the species‐level relationships and global population structure of Planes crabs collected from oceanic flotsam and sea turtles. Our results indicate that species diversity in this clade is low—likely three closely related species—with no evidence of cryptic or undescribed species. Moreover, our results indicate weak population differentiation among widely separated aggregations with genetic indices showing only subtle genetic discontinuities across all oceans of the world ({RADseq} {FST} = 0.08–0.16). The results of this study provide unprecedented resolution of the systematics and global biogeography of this group and contribute valuable information to our understanding of how theoretical dispersal potential relates to actual population differentiation and diversification among marine organisms. Moreover, these results demonstrate the limitations of single gene analyses and the value of genomic‐level resolution for estimating contemporary population structure in organisms with large, highly connected populations.},

The scientiﬁc underwater laboratory set up on Condor seamount offered an ideal case study for the ﬁrst documentation of litter distribution on a shallow seamount with historical ﬁshing. A total of 48 video transects deployed on the summit (n¼ 45) and the northern ﬂank (n¼ 3) covered an area of 0.031 and 0.025 km2, respectively, revealing 55 litter items. Litter density on the summit was 1439 litter items {kmÀ}2, whilst on the deeper northern ﬂank, estimates indicate densities of 397 litter items {kmÀ}2. Lost ﬁshing line was the dominant litter item encountered on both areas (73\% of total litter on the summit and 50\% on northern ﬂank), all being entirely or partly entangled in the locally abundant gorgonians Dentomuricea cf. meteor and Viminella ﬂagellum. Other items included lost weights, anchors and glass bottles. The predominance of lost ﬁshing gear identiﬁes the source of litter on Condor seamount as exclusively ocean-based and related to ﬁshing activities. Abundance of litter on the Condor seamount was much lower than that reported from other locations closer to populated areas.},

On the seafloor, marine litter, particularly plastic, can accumulate in high densities with deleterious consequences for its inhabitants.

Here, we present data on litter distribution and density collected during 588 video and trawl surveys across 32 sites in European waters. We found litter to be present in the deepest areas and at locations as remote from land as the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone across the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The highest litter density occurs in submarine canyons, whilst the lowest density can be found on continental shelves and on ocean ridges. Plastic was the most prevalent litter item found on the seafloor. Litter from fishing activities (derelict fishing lines and nets) was particularly common on seamounts, banks, mounds and ocean ridges. Our results highlight the extent of the problem and the need for action to prevent increasing accumulation of litter in marine environments.},

Densities of total debris varied from 0 to 1.940 items m−2, with plastics dominating both areas. Both beaches, presented the highest debris abundance in February, most probably related to prevailing winds and swell. Location and/or time of year also seemed to inﬂuence the type of debris present. These ﬁndings provide new insights into debris accumulation rates in the Azores, where no previous studies were made. It also conﬁrms the global trend of increased plastics accumulation on shorelines, highlighting the need for further research in remote islands.},

Fourteen polymers, having mainly thermoplastic origin, were identified; among them, the most represented are polyethylene (41.7\%) and polypropylene (36.9\%). Chemical and mechanical degradation were clearly observed by an {IR} spectrum. The thermogravimetric analysis curve of the plastic blend shows the melting point at 120–140 °C, and degradation occurs almost totally in a onestep process within 300–500 °C. The high heating value of the plastic debris is 43.9 {MJ} kg−1. Polymer blends obtained by beach debris show mechanical properties similar to the virgin high-density polyethylene polymer.

	abstract = {Plastic is incredibly abundant in marine environments but little is known about its effects on benthic microbiota and biogeochemical cycling. This study reports the shotgun metagenomic sequencing of biofilms fouling plastic and bioplastic microcosms staged at the sediment–water interface of a coastal lagoon. Community composition analysis revealed that plastic biofilms were indistinguishable in comparison to a ceramic biofilm control. By contrast, bioplastic biofilms were distinct and dominated by sulfate-reducing microorganisms ({SRM}). Analysis of bioplastic gene pools revealed the enrichment of esterases, depolymerases, adenylyl sulfate reductases ({aprBA}), and dissimilatory sulfite reductases ({dsrAB}). The nearly 20-fold enrichment of a phylogenetically diverse polyhydroxybutyrate ({PHB}) depolymerase suggests this gene was distributed across a mixed microbial assemblage. The metagenomic reconstruction of genomes identified novel species of Desulfovibrio, Desulfobacteraceae, and Desulfobulbaceae among the abundant {SRM}, and these genomes contained genes integral to both bioplastic degradation and sulfate reduction. Findings indicate that bioplastic promoted a rapid and significant shift in benthic microbial diversity and gene pools, selecting for microbes that participate in bioplastic degradation and sulfate reduction. If plastic pollution is traded for bioplastic pollution and sedimentary inputs are large, the microbial response could unintentionally affect benthic biogeochemical activities through the stimulation of sulfate reducers.},

Surveys of beach litter represent a fundamental tool for monitoring pollution in the marine environment and have been used world-wide to classify and quantify marine litter. Identifying the sources of marine and beach litter is, together with education, the prime weapon in combating this type of pollution. This work investigates the impact of three main potential land sources on litter occurrence: urban areas, rivers and beach users. Three sources were analyzed simultaneously on a broad scale (Lazio region, central Italy) using a random sampling design and ﬁtting a generalized linear mixedeffect model. The results show that urban areas are the main drivers for the occurrence of marine litter along central Italy's coastal ecosystems, suggesting that the presence of such litter on Lazio beaches could be effectively reduced by identifying failings in recycling and waste collection procedures and by improving waste processing systems and sewage treatment in urban areas.},

	abstract = {Sandy shores are generally considered important sinks for marine litter and the presence of this litter may represent a serious threat to biotic communities and dune integrity mostly due to cleaning activities carried out through mechanical equipment. In spring (April–May) 2012 we sampled 153 2 Â 2 m random plots to assess the spatial distribution patterns of litter on Central Italy sandy shores. We analysed the relationship between the presence of litter and coastal dune habitats along the sea-inland gradient. Our results showed that the most frequent litter items were plastic and polystyrene. Differences of marine litter spatial distribution were found between upper beach and fore dune habitats and ﬁxed dune habitats: embryo dune and mobile dune habitats show the highest frequency of litter, but, surprisingly, marine litter did not impact ﬁxed dune habitats, these possibly acting as a natural barrier protecting the inner part of the coast from marine litter dispersion.},

	abstract = {In a context of global changes, and amidst the perpetual modiﬁcation of community structure undergone by most natural ecosystems, it is more important than ever to understand how species interactions vary through space and time. The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions. It has, however, been hampered so far by the difﬁculty to quantify variation among interaction networks. Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of b-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up b-diversity of community composition to the b-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method. We illustrate the framework with a large dataset of hosts and parasites interactions and highlight other possible usages. We discuss a research agenda towards a biogeographical theory of species interactions.},

Hard plastics were found on every beach and foam was found at every beach except one. Rope/netting was the next most commonly found category, present at 23 beaches. Overall, plastic contributed to 60\% of the total weight of debris. Rope/netting (14.6\%) was a greater proportion of the weight from all beaches than foam (13.3\%). Non-ferrous metal contributed the smallest amount of debris by weight (1.7\%).

We investigated the microbial community composition and succession in coastal marine biofilms on plastic. Samples were collected over 75 days of immersion with strengthened samplings during the early stages of biofilm establishment. Biofilm composition was estimated using Illumina Miseq and microbial community interactions were assessed through microbial association network analysis. In silico analyses showed that primers used in most of previous studies considerably underestimated marine biofilm diversity. Unintentionally ignored so far, we showed that Flavobacteriia might be key actors in the functioning of marine biofilms. Gamma-proteobacteria from the genus Oleibacter strongly dominated microbial communities during the first hours of biofilm formation. These pioneer communities were quickly replaced by alpha-proteobacteria and Flavobacteriia. Bacterial communities exhibited fast temporal structure dynamics with taxa displaying rapid increases and declines. A total of 90\% of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) were intermittent or ephemeral reinforcing the conclusion that marine biofilms are highly dynamics. With 2/3 of positive significant connections between bacterial {OTUs}, microbial biofilm communities appear to be more inclined to develop inter-specific cooperation rather than competition and might thus form sets of functional guilds with mutual metabolic exchanges.},

	abstract = {Marine litter has been a serious and growing problem for some decades now. Yet, there is still much speculation among researchers, policy makers and planners about how to tackle marine litter from landbased sources. This paper provides insights into approaches for managing marine litter by reporting and analyzing survey results of litter dispersal and makeup from three areas along an Arab-Israeli coastal town in view of other recent studies conducted around the Mediterranean Sea. Based on our results and analysis, we posit that bathing beach activities should be a high priority for waste managers as a point of intervention and beach-goers must be encouraged to take a more active role in keeping beaches clean. Further, plastic fragments on the beach should be targeted as a ﬁrst priority for prevention (and cleanup) of marine litter with plastic bottle caps being a high priority to be targeted among plastics. More survey research is needed on non-plastic litter composition for which amounts and geographic dispersal in the region vary greatly from place to place along Mediterranean shores. In general, ﬁndings of this study lead us to recommend exploring persuasive beach trash can design coupled with greater enforcement for short term waste management intervention while considering the local socio-economic and institutional context further for long-term efforts.},

This large gap is evidence of our ignorance about the fate of plastics, as well as transformations and sinks in the oceans. One of the current challenges consists of identifying and quantifying plastic particles at the microscale, the small microplastics ({SMP}, 25−1000 μm). The aim of the present study is to investigate {SMP} concentration in count and in mass at the sea surface in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre during the sea campaign Expedition 7th Continent. After isolation, {SMP} were characterized by micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Microplastic distribution was modeled by a wind-driven vertical mixing correction model taking into account individual particle properties (dimension, shape and density). We demonstrate that {SMP} buoyancy is signiﬁcantly decreased compared to the large microplastics ({LMP}, 1−5 mm) and consequently more susceptible to vertical transport. The uncorrected {LMP} concentration in count was between 13 000 and 174 000 pieces km−2, and was between 5 and 170 times more abundant for {SMP}. With a wind-driven vertical mixing correction, we estimated that {SMP} were 300 to 70 000 times more abundant than {LMP}. When discussing this in terms of weight after correction, {LMP} concentrations were between 50 and 1000 g km−2, and {SMP} concentrations were between 5 and 14 000 g km−2.},

Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) on compositional data and indicator items discerned two more pathways of beach litter, i.e. in situ litter from beach goers and wind and/or runoﬀ transport of litter from land.

Still, very little is known about the metal content of plastic debris and about sorption/desorption processes, especially with respect to weathering. In this study, plastic debris collected from the North Atlantic subtropical gyre was analyzed for trace metals; as a comparison, new packaging materials were also analyzed. Both the new items and plastic debris showed very scattered concentrations. The new items contained signiﬁcant amounts of trace metals introduced as additives, but globally, metal concentrations were higher in the plastic debris. The results provide evidence that enhanced metal concentrations increase with the plastic state of oxidation for some elements, such as As, Ti, Ni, and Cd. Transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of mineral particles on the surface of the plastic debris. This work demonstrates that marine plastic debris carries complex mixtures of heavy metals. Such materials not only behave as a source of metals resulting from intrinsic plastic additives but also are able to concentrate metals from ocean water as mineral nanoparticles or adsorbed species.},

This study investigates the distribution of marine debris in the Biawak Island, Indramayu district, Indonesia. This study was conducted in November 2013 and 2014 by completing the standard form of the global International Coastal Cleanup ({ICC}) Network. By doing this, we aim to establish the condition and distribution of debris in the ecosystem area. The data collected from 7 stations along the coast of the Biawak island. The results showed that the total weight of marine debris ranged from 3-26 kg in each station with the highest density located at the eastern part of Biawak Island. The total weight of marine debris was 68 kg of 655 meters from total length 4.93 km of coastal line. Marine debris that found in the region predominantly composed of waste rope, styrofoam, and plastics. Debris from fishing activities also suggesting as a prevalent debris item found in the region. The result indicates that sources of debris transported from other regions by the ocean currents.},

As a result, various plastic formulations have been developed which state they deteriorate faster and/or have fewer impacts on the environment because their persistence is shorter. This study examined biodegradable, oxo-biodegradable, compostable, and high-density polyethylene (i.e., a conventional plastic carrier bag) materials over a 3 year period. These materials were exposed in three natural environments; open-air, buried in soil, and submersed in seawater, as well as in controlled laboratory conditions. In the marine environment, the compostable bag completely disappeared within 3 months. However, the same compostable bag type was still present in the soil environment after 27 months but could no longer hold weight without tearing. After 9 months exposure in the open-air, all bag materials had disintegrated into fragments. Collectively, our results showed that none of the bags could be relied upon to show any substantial deterioration over a 3 year period in all of the environments. It is therefore not clear that the oxo-biodegradable or biodegradable formulations provide suﬃciently advanced rates of deterioration to be advantageous in the context of reducing marine litter, compared to conventional bags.},

Despite its pristine reputation, this study demonstrates that anthropogenic debris can affect this remote and well protected area. Images of marine debris were taken using the {DeepSee} submersible, mainly plastic litter from ﬁshing gear were found between 200 and 350 m depth. A total of 40 items of debris were found in 5.48\% of 365 dives, 60\% of the items were plastics, and local boat and ﬁshing activities provided most of litter. Our aim with this research is to raise awareness about the potential problem of solid wastes and ﬁshing gear deposited in the deep environments of Isla del Coco National Park and to explore the potential implications for the ecological integrity of this protected area, including ghost ﬁshing and the possible ingestion of pollutants. These results provide useful management information for the area, especially if one considers the constant pressure of illegal ﬁshing and tourism at Isla del Coco National Park.},

Analyses included (1) microbial colonization rates on the bags, (2) examination of the surface structure, wettability, and chemistry, and (3) mass loss of the samples during incubation. On average, biodegradable plastic bags were colonized ﬁve times higher by aerobic and eight times higher by anaerobic microbes than polyethylene bags. Both types of bags showed no sign of biodegradation during this study. Therefore, marine sediment in temperate coastal zones may represent a long-term sink for plastic litter and also supposedly compostable material.},

	abstract = {Dispersal by passive oceanic rafting is considered important for the assembly of biotic communities on islands. However, not much is known about levels of population genetic connectivity maintained by rafting over transoceanic distances. We assess the evolutionary impact of kelp-rafting by estimating population genetic differentiation in three kelp-associated invertebrate species across a system of islands isolated by oceanic gaps for over 5 million years, using {mtDNA} and {AFLP} markers. The species occur throughout New Zealand's subantarctic islands, but lack pelagic stages and any opportunity for anthropogenic transportation, and hence must rely on passive rafting for long-distance dispersal. They all have been directly observed to survive transoceanic kelp-rafting journeys in this region. Our analyses indicate that regular gene flow occurs among populations of all three species between all of the islands, especially those on either side of the subtropical front oceanographic boundary. Notwithstanding its perceived sporadic nature, long-distance kelp-rafting appears to enable significant gene flow among island populations separated by hundreds of kilometres of open ocean.},

Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse plastisphere communities comprising prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ({DGGE}) and sequencing analysis revealed that plastisphere microbial communities on {PET} fragments varied both with season and location and comprised of bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and members of the eukaryotes Bacillariophyceae and Phaeophyceae. Polymers sampled from the sea surface mainly comprised polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene particles. Variation within plastisphere communities on different polymer types was observed, but communities were primarily dominated by Cyanobacteria. This research reveals that the composition of plastisphere microbial communities in marine waters varies with season, geographical location and plastic substrate type.},

Within this context, microplastic fragments (,5 mm) represent an emerging topic. Owing to their small size, they are readily ingested by marine wildlife and can accumulate in the food web, along with associated toxins and microorganisms colonising the plastic. We are starting to understand that plastic biofilms are diverse and are, comparably with non-plastic biofilms, driven by a complex network of influences, mainly spatial and seasonal factors, but also polymer type, texture and size of the substratum. Within this context, we should raise the question about the potential of plastic particles to serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms. The main focus of the review is the discussion of first insights and research gaps related to microplastic-associated microbial biofilm communities.},

Tensile strength of all materials decreased during exposure, but at different rates. Compostable plastic disappeared from our test rig between 16 and 24 weeks whereas approximately 98\% of the other plastics remained after 40 weeks. Some plastics require {UV} light to degrade. Transmittance of {UV} through oxo-biodegradable and standard polyethylene decreased as a consequence of fouling such that these materials received 90\% less {UV} light after 40 weeks. Our data indicate that compostable plastics may degrade relatively quickly compared to oxo-biodegradable and conventional plastics. While degradable polymers offer waste management solutions, there are limitations to their effectiveness in reducing hazards associated with plastic debris.},

	abstract = {The increasing demand for and reliance on plastics as an everyday item, and rapid rise in their production and subsequent indiscriminate disposal, rise in human population and industrial growth, have made the material an important environmental concern and focus of interest of many research. Historically, plastic production has increased tremendously to over 250 million tonnes by 2009 with an annual increased rate of 9\%. In 2015, the global consumption of plastic materials was reported to be {\textgreater} 300 million tonnes and is expected to surge exponentially. Because plastic polymers are ubiquitous, highly resistant to degradation, the influx of these persistent, complex materials is a risk to human and environmental health. Because microplastics are principally generated from the weathering or breakdown of larger plastics (macroplastics), it is noteworthy and expedient to discuss in detail, expatiate, and tackle this main source. Macro- and microplastic pollution has been reported on a global scale from the poles to the equator. The major problem of concern is that they strangulate and are ingested by a number of aquatic biota especially the filter feeders, such as molluscs, mussels, oysters, from where it enters the food chain and consequently could lead to physical and toxicological effects on aquatic organisms and human being as final consumers. To this end, in order to minimise the negative impacts posed by plastic pollution (macro- and microplastics), a plethora of strategies have been developed at various levels to reduce and manage the plastic wastes. The objective of this paper is to review some published literature on management measures of plastic wastes to curb occurrence and incidents of large- and microplastics pollution in the marine environments.},

Characterization of {MPs} was accomplished by gravimetry and digital image processing (for quantification and morphology categorization), and chemical composition identified by infrared spectroscopy and elemental analyses. Total {MPs} ranged from 1.40 to 21.3 particles/m3, which places Guanabara Bay amongst the most contaminated coastal systems worldwide by microplastics. Polyethylene and polypropylene polymers ≤1 mm were the most abundant particles.

Forty diﬀerent objects were collected and the ﬁve most frequent items were cotton fabric, string, polystyrene packing sheet, plastic packing tape and broken plastic pieces. The debris on Volunteer Beach was dominated by ﬁshing debris; 42\% of the items were discarded ﬁshing equipment, while 39\% of the items were of a packaging or associated nature. The mostly likely source of this household waste was ﬁshing vessels, with Falkland Islands Government ({FIG}) ﬁsheries observers seeing 27 of the 40 items of debris collected from Volunteer Beach being discarded from ﬁshing vessels.

Search and detection of {EFMD} using remote sensing are very challenging and are looking for new break-through scientific approaches. Besides, the significant costs associated with these techniques implemented up to now make its worldwide spread prohibitive. The main focus of this Doctorate Thesis in Information Management is to create an automatic detection method for {EFMD} using distinct remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing techniques for {EFMD} have important applications to readily monitor illegal dumping and natural disaster outputs, and to improve rescues at sea. Moreover, marine management improvement can be easily attained not only from more efficient cost-effective {EFMD} detection and collection, but also from better understand the quantitative links between {EFMD} and marine systems health. Remote sensing technological development is other possible achievement associated with this type of research, principally vising {ESA} new satellites scheduled to be release in a near future.},

              Microplastics are pollutants of concern in the freshwater and marine environments. These microparticles carry biofilm communities unique from the surrounding water. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of source water quality, microparticle type (
              i.e.
              , different polymers and morphologies), and microparticle size on the resulting biofilm microbial communities. Of particular interest was determining whether microbial agents were concentrated in these biofilm communities. A series of batch reactors were prepared to investigate the microbial communities observed in wastewater or river water compared to those in biofilm on microplastic or glass microspheres
              via
              amplicon sequencing. Sampling was performed after 48 h. {qPCR} was also performed for a fecal indicator organism marker ({BacHum}) and
              sul
              1 antibiotic resistance gene. The biofilm community structures varied as a function of source water and as a function of microparticle type: polystyrene spheres had different microbial community structures from polyethylene microparticles. The differences observed between microparticle types may be due to the morphology/surface texture rather than polymer composition given that some glass microspheres had similar microbial communities to polystyrene microspheres. For a given microparticle type and source water, size (106–125 μm
              versus
              355–425 μm for polystyrene microspheres, 125–250 μm
              versus
              250–500 μm for polyethylene microparticles) did not significantly impact the microbial community structure. While the biofilm microbial communities differed from communities in the surrounding water, the biofilm did not have a higher relative abundance of the indicator organism marker or
              sul
              1 genes than the reactor filtrate.},

The abundance and composition of benthic litter in the Northern and Central Adriatic Sea were investigated at 67 stations with bottom trawl nets. Average density of benthic litter was 913 ± 80 items/km2, ranking the Adriatic as one of the most polluted basins worldwide. Plastic was dominant in terms of numbers (80\%) and weight (62\%), and mainly consisted in bags, sheets and mussel nets. Higher quantities of litter were found in coastal areas, especially in front river mouths, coastal cities and mussel farms. In deep waters, litter hotspots were associated with most congested shipping lanes, indicating an additional litter input to the basin. Benthic litter composition resulted to be largely driven by the vicinity to local sources, i.e. mussel farming installations and most congested shipping routes. These ﬁndings provide useful insights to set measures to manage marine litter in the Adriatic region, and possibly to minimize this anthropogenic pollution.},

Nineteen surveys were done from June 2012 to March 2015 on eight beaches that spanned the coast of Israel. Average debris density was 12.1 items per 100 m2 and 90\% of the items were plastic. The top debris categories were food wrappers and disposables, plastic bags and cigarette butts.

The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel together with The Israeli Diving Federation established the diver volunteer program “Sea Guard” (“Mishmar Hayam” in Hebrew), which supports marine conservation through citizen science. The divers were trained in marine ecology and survey methods to conduct independent surveys and lead underwater cleanups. For the first time, we have described the patterns of benthic debris density and composition in the nearshore environment of the southeastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. We found that benthic marine debris in the nearshore along the Israeli Mediterranean coast is primarily plastic, likely originating from the use of local beaches. Fishing, boating and domestic activities also play an important role as sources for marine debris. The currents' regime prevented the debris from accumulating on the seafloor in the nearshore environment, with the exception of several “debris traps”. Our findings will be useful for the development of programs to improve coastal waste management.},

The biomass of the fouling layer increased significantly over time and all samples became heavy enough to sink to the seafloor. The fouling communities, consisting of 21 families, were distinct between habitats, but not between polymer types. Positive primary production was measured in the pelagic, but not in the benthic habitat, suggesting that large accumulations of floating plastic could pose a source of oxygen for local ecosystems, as well as a carbon sink. Contrary to {PE}, the biodegradable plastic showed a significant loss of tensile strength and disintegrated over time in both habitats. These results indicate that in the marine environment, biodegradable polymers may disintegrate at higher rates than conventional polymers. This should be considered for the development of new materials, environmental risk assessment and waste management strategies.},

The main competitors in the field either have optimal worst-case complexity but the worst case happens frequently, or they are very efficient for some tree shapes but degenerate for others. This leads to unpredictable and often infeasible runtimes. There is no obvious way to choose between the algorithms.
            
              In this article we present {RTED}, a robust tree edit distance algorithm. The asymptotic complexity of our algorithm is smaller than or equal to the complexity of the best competitors for any input instance, that is, our algorithm is both efficient and worst-case optimal. This is achieved by computing a dynamic decomposition strategy that depends on the input trees. {RTED} is shown optimal among all algorithms that use {LRH} (
              left-right-heavy
              ) strategies, which include {RTED} and the fastest tree edit distance algorithms presented in literature. In our experiments on synthetic and real-world data we empirically evaluate our solution and compare it to the state-of-the-art.},

The recovery of a satellite-tracked current drifter on a South African beach some 22 months after release off Western Australia was an indicator of the ocean-wide processes operating in the southern Indian Ocean gyre. Using this single drift trajectory in combination with data from other current drifters released along the Western Australian coast between 2008 and 2013, from earlier satellite-tracked drifters and a selection of historical drift bottle returns, drift patterns across the southern Indian Ocean between Western Australia and east Africa were analysed to quantify inter-continental debris transport rates via the South Equatorial Current (northern east-west pathway) and the South Indian Ocean Current (southern west-east pathway). The northern east-west trans-ocean pathway can be considered in three segments: the complex and highly variable Leeuwin Current eddy system in the east, which can retain drifting debris for up to a year, the comparatively uniform westward travel in the South Equatorial Current, and the eddying components in the western boundary current system off southern Africa. A simple Eddy Activity Index is derived here to clearly distinguish the Leeuwin Current eddy region from the South Equatorial Current. The southern route to Australia is simpler via the Agulhas Return Current and the South Indian Ocean Current.},

We combined data from previously published reports with an intensive sampling in inshore waters of the Northwestern Mediterranean. The highest plastic concentrations were found in regions distant from from land as well as in the first kilometer adjacent to the coastline. In this nearshore water strip, plastic concentrations were significantly correlated with the nearness to a coastal human population, with local areas close to large human settlements showing hundreds of thousands of plastic pieces per km2. The ratio of plastic to plankton abundance reached particularly high values for the coastal surface waters. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamides were the predominant plastic polymers at all distances from coast (86 to 97\% of total items), although the diversity of polymers was higher in the 1-km coastal water strip due to a higher frequency of polystyrene or polyacrylic fibers. The plastic size distributions showed a gradual increase in abundance toward small sizes indicating an efficient removal of small plastics from the surface. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of small fragments ({\textless} 2 mm) was higher within the 1-km coastal water strip, suggesting a rapid fragmentation down along the shoreline, likely related with the washing ashore on the beaches. This study constitutes a first attempt to determine the impact of plastic debris in areas closest to Mediterranean coast. The presence of a high concentration of plastic including tiny plastic items could have significant environmental, health and economic impacts.},

The main objective of this work was to address the impact of beach kiosk presence on the occurrence of marine debris in a highly frequented beach in Southeast Brazil. For this work, three areas close to kiosks and three areas distant from kiosks were chosen for sampling and comparison. We conducted three transects at each location, each one including two meters of vegetation, from which debris was collected. Samples were taken to the laboratory so that they could be weighed and the debris was classified according to material. Our results show that, in every scenario, plastic was the most frequently found material. In addition, the amount of paper was found to be higher in areas close to kiosks. Presence of kiosks does not have an overall direct impact on the amount of litter. However, we found vegetated areas to have significantly higher volumes of debris, both in areas with and without beach kiosks.},

	abstract = {While natural marine habitats with motion capabilities, e.g., kelps and seaweeds, have been studied alongside their associated fouling communities, little is known of the effect of motion on the communities of ﬂoating artiﬁcial habitats such as buoys, rafts, and pontoons, particularly in tropical systems. Hydrodynamic features greatly differ between ﬂoating and ﬁxed artiﬁcial substrata, which in turn affect the structure of their associated communities. This study tested the hypothesis that ﬂoating and ﬁxed artiﬁcial installations in a tropical reef system (Eilat, Red Sea) would support different benthic communities throughout space and time. Speciﬁcally, we examined differences in communities recruited onto settlement plates between ﬂoating and ﬁxed installations deployed at three different sites, along a two-year monitoring period. The three sites exhibited distinct differences in species assemblages between the monitoring dates (6, 12, 18 and 24 months post deployment), mainly between the ﬁrst and the last two dates. The average level of dissimilarity between ﬂoating and ﬁxed installations increased over time at all sites. Over 50\% of the dissimilarity between the ﬂoating and ﬁxed installations resulted from ﬁve taxonomic groups i.e., bryozoans, bivalves, barnacles, sponges, including the amount of bare space on the settlement plates. The contribution of these groups to the dissimilarity changed both temporally within each site, and spatially among sites. The observed differences were related to the hydrodynamic characteristics of ﬂoating and ﬁxed habitats, interacting with biotic features such as predation, successional processes and seasonality; and abiotic features including smallscale spatial changes, light, and position in the water column.},

	abstract = {Floating aggregations of seagrass wrack can serve as an ecological “hot spot” contributing to the survival of many species in the form of habitat and food source. Considerable research has been conducted on seagrass wrack that is washed ashore, but here we demonstrate that large amounts of ﬂoating wrack produced in Greater Florida Bay can be advected great distances from their source, remain buoyant for weeks, and provide a nutrient subsidy into surrounding waters. Drifters tracking the location of ﬂoating Syringodium ﬁliforme wracks revealed that movement of the wrack is strongly correlated to wind speed with total daily movement ranging from 10 to 40 km d−1. In mesocosm experiments, shedding followed an exponential model with highest rates estimated for loose aggregations of S. ﬁliforme (−0.124 d−1) compared to Thalassia testudinum (-0.047 d−1). Aggregated whorled S. ﬁliforme wrack found oﬀshore had an order of magnitude lower shedding with a rate of −0.013 d−1 suggesting it could remain buoyant for several months. Both wrack and the ﬂoating macroalgae Sargassum sp. released considerable amounts of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) and colored dissolved organic material ({CDOM}) daily into the dark mesocosm treatments. {CDOM} represented a constant proportion of the {DOC} exudate with a spectral slope suggestive of humic materials. Sargassum sp. produced twice as much {DOC} and {CDOM} compared to seagrass wrack. No net release of dissolved nitrogen was measurable in the treatments during the ﬁrst 5 to 6 days while vegetation was photosynthetically viable, but particulate organic matter increased in the treatments consistent with the growth of bacterioplankton (C:N ∼7). Similar to Sargassum sp., seagrass wrack can be advected oﬀshore and serve as a carbon and nitrogen source for organisms in oligotrophic waters.},

Despite overwhelming evidence of the threat of plastic in the marine environment, there remains inadequate or limited policies to address their mitigation, particularly microplastic debris. Existing policies for waste management, marine debris monitoring and awareness campaigns were evaluated from other jurisdictions. Policies and recommendations were developed for the Canadian context.

	abstract = {{TAAF} ensures since 2007 the management of 5 small tropical islands lying in the southwestern Indian Ocean: the Iles Eparses. These islands share an exceptional natural heritage including many marine and terrestrial endemic species. At a regional scale the Iles Eparses are some of the most pristine ecosystems, largely preserved from anthropogenic impacts due to their geographical isolation and a historically very limited human occupation. In this context, {TAAF} wished that Iles Eparses become unique natural laboratories for earth scientists and environmental process observation e like climate change impacts - but also sustainable biodiversity sanctuaries for which the scientiﬁc community should provide baseline ecological data to inform on appropriate conservation tools. An inter-agency research consortium emerged in 2009 to meet this commitment for the Iles Eparses. This program was intended to set a science framework in accordance with France' objectives for Research and Conservation. It enabled between 2009 and 2014 the implementation of 18 cross-disciplinary research projects ranging from geology to ecology and represented by the variety of the proposed articles in this special issue. Altogether research projects have dramatically increased knowledge on the Iles Eparses' ecosystems and have provided the ﬁrst overview of their diversity, their functions and their dynamics and its determinants. In particular applied research efforts have supplied a signiﬁcant amount of ecological evidence that is now available to develop optimal conservation strategy to ensure the Iles Eparses' long-term biodiversity value. These ﬁndings point out that the continuation of research activity in the Iles Eparses should be considered a priority.},

	abstract = {The distribution, type and quantity of marine litter accumulated on the bathyal and abyssal Mediterranean seaﬂoor has been studied in the framework of the Spanish national projects {PROMETEO} and {DOS} {MARES} and the {ESF}-{EuroDEEP} project {BIOFUN}. Litter was collected with an otter trawl and Agassiz trawl while sampling for megafauna on the Blanes canyon and adjacent slope (Catalan margin, north-western Mediterranean) between 900 and 2700 m depth, and on the western, central and eastern Mediterranean basins at 1200, 2000 and 3000 m depth. All litter was sorted into 8 categories (hard plastic, soft plastic, glass, metal, clinker, fabric, longlines and ﬁshing nets) and weighed. The distribution of litter was analysed in relation to depth, geographic area and natural (bathymetry, currents and rivers) and anthropogenic (population density and shipping routes) processes. The most abundant litter types were plastic, glass, metal and clinker. Lost or discarded ﬁshing gear was also commonly found. On the Catalan margin, although the data indicated an accumulation of litter with increasing depth, mean weight was not significantly different between depths or between the open slope and the canyon. We propose that litter accumulated in the canyon, with high proportions of plastics, has predominantly a coastal origin, while litter collected on the open slope, dominated by heavy litter, is mostly ship-originated, especially at sites under major shipping routes. Along the trans-Mediterranean transect, although a higher amount of litter seemed to be found on the Western Mediterranean, differences of mean weight were not signiﬁcant between the 3 geographic areas and the 3 depths. Here, the shallower sites, also closer to the coast, had a higher proportion of plastics than the deeper sites, which had a higher proportion of heavy litter and were often affected by shipping routes. The weight of litter was also compared to biomass of megafauna from the same samples. On the Blanes slope, the biomass of megafauna was signiﬁcantly higher than the weight of litter between 900 and 2000 m depth and no signiﬁcant differences were found at 2250 and 2700 m depth. Along the trans-Mediterranean transect, no signiﬁcant differences were found between biomass and litter weight at all sites except in two sites: the Central Mediterranean at 1200 m depth, where biomass was higher than litter weight, and the Eastern Mediterranean at 1200 m depth, where litter weight was higher than biomass. The results are discussed in the framework of knowledge on marine litter accumulation, its potential impact on the habitat and fauna and the legislation addressing these issues.},

Here we present the results of surveys in two important European shellﬁsh culture areas that release rafting {AIS}, the Venetian lagoon and the Portuguese Algarve region. We found eight aquaculture-related non-native, invasive species attached to anthropogenic litter items mostly related to aquaculture: Amphibalanus amphitrite, Austrominius modestus, Balanus trigonus, Hesperibalanus fallax, Hydroides elegans, Hydroides sanctaecrucis, and Magallana angulata. These species are well-adapted to rafting on artiﬁcial surfaces and have a high potential to disperse via this vector. This is the ﬁrst record of the notorious nuisance species H. sanctaecrucis both in the Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic, as well as on ﬂoating litter. We also present the ﬁrst records of M. angulata, H. sanctaecrucis, Sabellaria alveolata, Mytilus edulis and Chthamalus montagui on stranded anthropogenic litter.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic plastic pollution is a global problem. In the marine environment, one of its less studied effects is the transport of attached biota, which might lead to introductions of non-native species in new areas or aid in habitat expansions of invasive species. The goal of the present work was to assess if the material composition of beached anthropogenic litter is indicative of the rafting fauna in a coastal area and could thus be used as a simple and cost-efficient tool for risk assessment in the future. Beached anthropogenic litter and attached biota along the 200 km coastline of Asturias, central Bay of Biscay, Spain, were analysed. The macrobiotic community attached to fouled litter items was identified using genetic barcoding combined with visual taxonomic analysis, and compared between hard plastics, foams, other plastics and non-plastic items. On the other hand, the material composition of beached litter was analysed in a standardized area on each beach. From these two datasets, the expected frequency of several rafting taxa was calculated for the coastal area and compared to the actually observed frequencies. The results showed that plastics were the most abundant type of beached litter. Litter accumulation was likely driven by coastal sources (industry, ports) and river/sewage inputs and transported by near-shore currents. Rafting vectors were almost exclusively made up of plastics and could mainly be attributed to fishing activity and leisure/ household. We identified a variety of rafting biota, including species of goose barnacles, acorn barnacles, bivalves, gastropods, polychaetes and bryozoan, and hydrozoan colonies attached to stranded litter. Several of these species were non-native and invasive, such as the giant Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and the Australian barnacle (Austrominius modestus). The composition of attached fauna varied strongly between litter items of different materials. Plastics, except for foam, had a much more diverse attached community than non-plastic materials. The predicted frequency of several taxa attached to beached litter significantly correlated with the actually observed frequencies. Therefore we suggest that the composition of stranded litter on a beach or an area could allow for predictions about the corresponding attached biotic community, including invasive species.},

Many environmental changes have occurred in the harbor over the past 63 years. The harbor land mass of the outer harbor has been expanded towards the breakwater, channels deepened, and the water quality improved as a result of pollution abatement. Existing pilings removed, replaced or covered with two layers of polyethylene. The isopod Limnoria tripunctata and the bivalve Lyrodus pedicellatus were the principal species. The station located in the Consolidated Slip area of the inner harbor was the site of 87 and 58 percent of the Limnoria and Lyrodus, respectively, counted during the study. Neither of these species present at this station in 1950-1951. The dissolved oxygen concentration at this station improved from a mean of 0.1 ppm in 1950-1951 to a mean of 6.7 in 2013-2014 as a result of improved environmental conditions. Larval settlement at Cerritos Channel numbered in the thousands in 1950-1951 but only 22 were counted during the 2013-2014 survey. This difference was attributed to the effect of piling covering or removal. It is recommended that existing creosoted pilings be covered or removed in the inner harbor area since this was the region of greatest occurrence of wood borers in 2013-2014.},

In this study we used scanning electron microscopy to characterize biodiversity of organisms on the surface of 68 small floating plastics (length range = 1.7–24.3 mm, median = 3.2 mm) from Australia-wide coastal and oceanic, tropical to temperate sample collections. Diatoms were the most diverse group of plastic colonizers, represented by 14 genera. We also recorded ‘epiplastic’ coccolithophores (7 genera), bryozoans, barnacles (Lepas spp.), a dinoflagellate (Ceratium), an isopod (Asellota), a marine worm, marine insect eggs (Halobates sp.), as well as rounded, elongated, and spiral cells putatively identified as bacteria, cyanobacteria, and fungi. Furthermore, we observed a variety of plastic surface microtextures, including pits and grooves conforming to the shape of microorganisms, suggesting that biota may play an important role in plastic degradation. This study highlights how anthropogenic millimeter-sized polymers have created a new pelagic habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates. The ecological ramifications of this phenomenon for marine organism dispersal, ocean productivity, and biotransfer of plastic-associated pollutants, remains to be elucidated.},

These buoyant macroscopic particles can be mixed within the upper water column by turbulent transport. Models indicate that the largest decrease in their concentration occurs within the ﬁrst few metres of water, where in situ observations are very scarce. In order to investigate the depth proﬁle and physical properties of buoyant plastic debris, we used a new type of multi-level trawl at 12 sites within the North Atlantic subtropical gyre to sample from the air–seawater interface to a depth of 5 m, at 0.5 m intervals. Our results show that plastic concentrations drop exponentially with water depth, and decay rates decrease with increasing Beaufort number. Furthermore, smaller pieces presented lower rise velocities and were more susceptible to vertical transport. This resulted in higher depth decays of plastic mass concentration (milligrams m−3) than numerical concentration (pieces m−3). Further multilevel sampling of plastics will improve our ability to predict at-sea plastic load, size distribution, drifting pattern, and impact on marine species and habitats.},

Derelict fish traps are thought to cause fish mortality through unintentional fishing or ghost fishing; yet no scientific studies have been conducted to quantify the threat from ghost fishing in Caribbean waters. Using an experimental approach, 12 unbaited traps were deployed at nearshore and offshore locations in the {US} Virgin Islands to simulate derelict traps. Six traps were set with escape panels closed (fishing) and six had escape panels open. Frequent underwater visual surveys of fishes inside and surrounding traps were conducted to quantify fish assemblage composition, body size, fish behavior, condition, and mortality over 6 mo. Twenty mortalities (2\% of trapped fish observed) were documented. All but one mortality occurred in closed traps with an estimated total market value of {US}\$160 over 6 mo or {US}\$52 per trap annually. Skin abrasions were observed on 34 fishes. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of time on trapped fish assemblages regardless of the location. The results demonstrate that ghost fishing does occur, but that simple modifications to fishing gear such as correctly functioning escape panels will significantly reduce mortality from ghost fishing. Further reduction of impact from derelict traps can be achieved through implementation of land-based trap disposal programs.},

Although there is a fossil record of species invasions occurring in waves after geographic barriers had been lifted, such episodic events differ markedly from human-assisted invasions in spatial and temporal scales and in the number and diversity of organisms involved in longdistance dispersal. Today, every region of the planet is simultaneously affected and modern rates of invasion are several orders of magnitude higher than prehistoric rates. In terms of its rate and geographical extent, its potential for synergistic disruption and the scope of its evolutionary consequences, the current mass invasion event is without precedent and should be regarded as a unique form of global change. Prehistoric examples of biotic interchanges are nonetheless instructive and can increase our understanding of species-area effects, evolutionary effects, biotic resistance to invasion, and the impacts of novel functional groups introduced to na¨ıve biotas. Nevertheless, they provide only limited insight into the synergistic effects of invasions and other environmental stressors, the effect of frequent introductions of large numbers of propagules, and global homogenization, all of which characterize the current mass invasion event.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of debris is an insidious problem throughout the world’s oceans. Here we document 234.24 items of macro-debris/km2 in the shallow populated parts of Majuro lagoon (Republic of the Marshall Islands) which is the second highest standing stock of macro-debris recorded to date in any benthic marine habitat in the world. The majority of macro-debris was from household sources (78.7\%) with the peak abundance recorded in areas of medium afﬂuence. Marine debris causes suffocation, shading, tissue abrasion and mortality of corals and we show a signiﬁcant negative correlation exists between the level of hard coral cover and coverage of marine debris. Given long decomposition times, even if the input of rubbish to Majuro lagoon is stopped immediately, the standing stock of debris will persist for centuries. Multiple new initiatives are needed to curtail the direct and indirect dumping of waste in Majuro lagoon. Crown Copyright Ó 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For this, we exposed the Asian green mussel Perna viridis to 4 concentrations (0 mg/l, 21.6 mg/l, 216 mg/l, 2160 mg/l) of suspended polyvinylchloride ({PVC}) particles (1–50 μm) for two 2-hour-time-periods per day. After 44 days, mussel ﬁltration and respiration rates as well as byssus production were found to be a negative function of particle concentration. Furthermore, within 91 days of exposure, mussel survival declined with increasing {PVC} abundance. These negative effects presumably go back to prolonged periods of valve closure as a reaction to particle presence. We suggest that microplastics constitute a new seston component that exerts a stress comparable to natural suspended solids.},

The footage was collected by a Remotely Operated Vehicle ({ROV}) and a manned submersible at depths ranging between 40 and 525 m. The mean litter density in the passage was 0.26 ± 0.03 items·100 m−1 (±{SE}) and was signiﬁcantly higher between 151 and 250 m compared to other depth strata. Overall, derelict ﬁshing gear, mostly made of plastic, were the most common objects found on the seaﬂoor, representing 64\% of all items. Although we observed few evidence of direct deleterious effects by the litter, interactions with fauna were observed in more than half of the items. This study makes an important contribution in quantifying the abundance of marine litter on the seaﬂoor of the Azores. The location of the Faial-Pico Passage, close to shore, makes it an appropriate site for long-term monitoring of litter on the seaﬂoor and evaluate the efﬁciency of upcoming public policies aimed at reducing litter input into the oceans.},

	abstract = {A central and perhaps insurmountable challenge of invasion ecology is to predict which combinations of species and habitats most effectively promote and prevent biological invasions. Here, we integrate models of network structure and nonlinear population dynamics to search for potential generalities among trophic factors that may drive invasion success and failure. We simulate invasions where 100 different species attempt to invade 150 different food webs with 15–26 species and a wide range (0.06–0.32) of connectance. These simulations yield 11 438 invasion attempts by non-basal species, 47 per cent of which are successful. At the time of introduction, whether or not the invader is a generalist best predicts final invasion success; however, once the invader establishes itself, it is best distinguished from unsuccessful invaders by occupying a lower trophic position and being relatively invulnerable to predation. In general, variables that reflect the interaction between an invading species and its new community, such as generality and trophic position, best predict invasion success; however, for some trophic categories of invaders, fundamental species traits, such as having the centre of the feeding range low on the theoretical niche axis (for non-omnivorous and omnivorous herbivores), or the topology of the food web (for tertiary carnivores), best predict invasion success. Across all invasion scenarios, a discriminant analysis model predicted successful and failed invasions with 76.5 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of introduction or 100 per cent accuracy for properties at the time of establishment. More generally, our results suggest that tackling the challenge of predicting the properties of species and habitats that promote or inhibit invasions from food web perspective may aid ecologists in identifying rules that govern invasions in natural ecosystems.},

It is important to understand the intellectual legacies underpinning macrosystems ecology: How the subdiscipline ﬁts within, builds upon, differs from and extends previous theories. We trace the rise of macrosystems ecology with respect to preceding theories and present a new hypothesis that integrates the multiple components of macrosystems theory. The spatio-temporal anthropogenic rescaling ({STAR}) hypothesis suggests that human activities are altering the scales of ecological processes, resulting in interactions at novel space–time scale combinations that are diverse and predictable. We articulate four predictions about how human actions are “expanding”, “shrinking”, “speeding up” and “slowing down” ecological processes and interactions, and thereby generating new scaling relationships for ecological patterns and processes. We provide examples of these rescaling processes and describe ecological consequences across terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Rescaling depends in part on characteristics including connectivity, stability and heterogeneity. Our {STAR} hypothesis challenges traditional assumptions about how the spatial and temporal scales of processes and interactions operate in different types of ecosystems and provides a lens through which to understand macrosystem-scale environmental change.},

	abstract = {Text mining and analytics may offer possibilities to assess scientists’ professional writing and identify patterns of co-occurrence between words and phrases associated with different environmental challenges and their potential solutions. This approach has the potential to help to track emerging issues, semi-automate horizon scanning processes, and identify how different institutions or policy instruments are associated with different types of ocean and coastal sustainability challenges. Here I examine ecologically-oriented ocean and coastal science journal article abstracts published between 2006 and 2015. Informed by the Institutional Analysis and Development ({IAD}) framework, I constructed a dictionary containing phrases associated with 40 ocean challenges and 15 solution-oriented instrument or investments. From 50,817 potentially relevant abstracts, different patterns of co-occurring text associated with challenges and potential solutions were discernable. Topics receiving signiﬁcantly increased attention in the literature in 2014–15 relative to the 2006–13 period included: marine plastics and debris; environmental conservation; social impacts; ocean acidiﬁcation; general terrestrial inﬂuences; co-management strategies; ocean warming; licensing and access rights; oil spills; and economic impacts. Articles relating to global environmental change were consistently among the most cited; marine plastics and ecosystem trophic structure were also focal topics among the highly cited articles. This exploratory research suggests that scientists’ written outputs provide fertile ground for identifying and tracking important and emerging ocean sustainability issues and their possible solutions, as well as the organizations and scientists who work on them.},

Surface net tows were collected between Hobart, Tasmania and Sydney, Australia during the spring of 2013 and 2014 and compared with a subset of data from autumn 2012 from the same region. Substantial inter-annual variation in mean plastic abundance was observed over the three year period, ranging from to 248.04–3711.64 pieces km− 2, conﬁrming the need for multiple years of sampling to fully estimate the extent of, and trends in, plastic pollution.},

Plastic debris were persistent during all sampling periods on the surface of the Channel, composed mainly by the microplastic sizes. Average particle abundances ranged from 138,293 items,{kmÀ}2 in autumn to 347,793 items,{kmÀ}2 during the spring, while weight densities varied from 458.15 {gðDWÞ},{kmÀ}2 in winter to 2016.67 {gðDWÞ},{kmÀ}2 in summer. Rigid plastics were the most frequent particles in all the periods analysed (from 89.40\%-winter to 94.54\%-spring). The high-resolution and particle distribution models corroborated that the oceanographic variability shapes different patterns of presence of plastics, and in particular the existence of areas with almost no plastics.},

The density of debris in the Straits was correlated with terrestrial vegetation, and peaked close to urban centres, indicating the predominance of land-based sources. In the Bay of Bengal, debris density increased north of 17°N mainly due to small fragments probably carried in run-off from the Ganges Delta. The low densities in the Bay of Bengal relative to model predictions may result from biofouling-induced sinking and wind-driven export of debris items. Standardised data collection protocols are needed for counts of ﬂoating debris, particularly as regards the size classes used, to facilitate comparisons among studies.},

Daily sampling collected 2.5 (range 2.1–3.4) times more litter items than weekly samples and 1.7 (1.3–2.3) times more litter by mass. Low density items such as foamed polystyrene showed a greater differential (4–5 times more items from daily sampling), presumably due to faster turnover of lightweight litter items. Variation in weekly samples was not consistently less than daily estimates, suggesting that less frequent samples only partly integrate short-term ﬂuctuations in litter dynamics.

	abstract = {Identifying the sources of small plastic fragments is challenging because the original source item seldom can be identiﬁed. South Africa provides a useful model system to understand the factors inﬂuencing the distribution of beach litter because it has an open coastline with four equally-spaced urban-industrial centres distant from other major source areas. We sampled mesodebris ({\textasciitilde}2e25 mm) at 82 South African beaches in 1994, 2005 and 2015. Plastic items comprised 99\% by number and 95\% by mass of litter items. Industrial pellets were the most abundant plastic items, but fragments of rigid plastic items comprised most of the mass of debris. Strong correlations between industrial pellets and other plastic items indicate that common factors inﬂuence the distribution of both pellets and secondary mesoplastics. The abundance of mesodebris at beaches also was correlated in successive surveys, suggesting that beach-speciﬁc factors (e.g. aspect, slope, local currents, etc.) inﬂuence the amounts of debris on each beach. Sample year had no effect on mesodebris abundance, indicating that there has been little change in the amounts of mesodebris over the last two decades. There were consistently higher densities of both industrial pellets and other plastic items at beaches close to urban-industrial centres; there were only weak correlations with human population density and no correlation with local runoff. The size of industrial pellets decreased away from local urban centres, further supporting the conclusion that, like macroplastic litter, most mesoplastic pollution on continental beaches derives from local, land-based sources. This ﬁnding means that local actions to reduce plastics entering the sea will have local beneﬁts, and that it may be possible to assess the efﬁcacy of mitigation measures to reduce marine inputs of mesoplastic items.},

The North sector of the area presents higher {FMD} diversity and abundances, probably as a result of the high number of navigation corridors and ﬁsheries operating in that sector. Most {FMD} originate from local sources, namely discharges from vessels and derelict material from ﬁsheries.

	abstract = {The present study aims to analyse the local and regional variability in the density and typology of marine debris on fishing grounds on the northern Mediterranean continental shelf, and to test relationships between marine litter and trawl fishing activity. Moreover, the colonization of plastics was examined in order to study the importance of plastics as a source of impact on marine communities and their further environmental implications. This study surveyed 11 sites, associated with trawling grounds and subjected to different levels of fishing intensity, located in four areas of the Mediterranean: one in Italy, the Central Tyrrhenian coast, one in Greece, the eastern Ionian coast, and two in Spain, the Murcian and Catalan coasts. Samples were collected during an oceanographic cruise undertaken from the 21 May to the 24 June 2009. Results showed geographical variation in the density of marine debris which ranged from 0 to 405 pieces per hectare in the surveyed areas, plastics being the dominant components. Variability within sites was higher than between areas, indicating small-scale patchiness in the distribution of the debris over the seafloor. Though the study areas were within trawling grounds, the density of debris was not significantly correlated with fishing effort. More than 30\% of plastics were between 10 and 20 cm width/ length, and more than 40\% of the plastics were colonized by a biofilm of microorganisms, suggesting indirect effects on benthic communities.},

A conceptual model for the chronological interpretation of the date prints is proposed and cross-compared with a dense time-series of satellite images and orthophotos. It appears that the litter-derived ages are capable of reproducing information on both the timing and the extent of overwash occurrence.

Moreover, we reviewed observations of additional zoantharians as macrofouling organisms, and discuss the possible role of rafting in the dispersal of this cosmopolitan group. Traits reported to some zoantharian species, such as hermaphroditism and resistance to desiccation, support their dispersal potential by drifting attached to ﬂoating objects. Further reports of zoantharian species covering ﬂoating artiﬁcial structures and natural debris are needed to increase our knowledge of dispersal mechanisms in the oceans. Additionally, this information is essential to monitor and manage possible exotic species invasions, especially for zoantharian species that are common in the aquarium trade.},

	abstract = {Marine debris is a major challenge threatening ocean and coastal environment with no easy solution in coming years. The problem is totally manmade and extendeds to coastal areas around the world. The accumulation of marine debris is largely due to lack of awareness and environmental education among the public reinforced with mismanagement of municipal litter in coastal cities. Iran has about 2415 km of coastlines in the north and south of the country that suffer severely from a marine debris problem. Despite the great scale of the problem that leads to the shutdown of some beaches to beachgoers, there are no documented data on the abundance, composition and sources of marine debris dispersed on beaches. With the cooperation of marine biology student volunteers, we surveyed beaches at two scales, 100 m and 1 km searching for litter in varying ranges. The results revealed that the most common items are made of plastic/polystyrene. Tourism and recreational activities are responsible for more than 90\% of litter production on the study beach. Fisheries and aquaculture are the second source of most abundant marine litter found on the beach with considerable distance from tourism activities. We conclude that lack of education about the consequences of marine litter is the main reason for marine debris at the study beach. Another reason is related to rapid construction of coastal areas and development of coastal cities with no proper infrastructure to manage municipal littering.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic marine debris is an increasing concern because of its potential negative impacts on marine ecosystems. This is a global problem that will have lasting effects for many reasons, including: (1) the input of debris into marine environments is likely to continue (commensurate with population increase and globalization), (2) accumulation, and possibly retention, of debris will occur in speciﬁc areas due to hydrography and geomorphology, and (3) the most common types of debris observed to date will likely persist for centuries. Due to the technical challenges and prohibitive costs of conducting research in the deep sea, little is known about the abundance, types, sources, and impacts of human refuse on this vast habitat, and the extreme depths to which this debris is penetrating has only recently been exposed. We reviewed 1149 video records of marine debris from 22 years of remotely operated vehicle deployments in Monterey Bay, covering depths from 25 m to 3971 m. We characterize debris by type, examine patterns of distribution, and discuss potential sources and dispersal mechanisms. Debris was most abundant within Monterey Canyon where aggregation and downslope transport of debris from the continental shelf are enhanced by natural canyon dynamics. The majority of debris was plastic (33\%) and metal (23\%). The highest relative frequencies of plastic and metal observations occurred below 2000 m, indicating that previous studies may greatly underestimate the extent of anthropogenic marine debris on the seaﬂoor due to limitations in observing deeper regions. Our ﬁndings provide evidence that submarine canyons function to collect debris and act as conduits for debris transport from coastal to deep-sea habitats.},

However, understanding interactions between plastic and microbes in the “Plastisphere”—the thin layer of life on the surface of {PMD}—has been technologylimited. Research into microbe–microbe and microbe–substrate interactions requires knowledge of community phylogenetic composition but also tools to visualize spatial distributions of intact microbial biofilm communities. We developed a {CLASI}-{FISH} (combinatorial labelling and spectral imaging – fluorescence in situ hybridization) method using confocal microscopy to study Plastisphere communities. We created a probe set consisting of three existing phylogenetic probes (targeting all Bacteria, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria) and four newly designed probes (targeting Bacteroidetes, Vibrionaceae, Rhodobacteraceae and Alteromonadaceae) labelled with a total of seven fluorophores and validated this probe set using pure cultures. Our nested probe set strategy increases confidence in taxonomic identification because targets are confirmed with two or more probes, reducing false positives. We simultaneously identified and visualized these taxa and their spatial distribution within the microbial biofilms on polyethylene samples in colonization time series experiments in coastal environments from three different biogeographical regions. Comparing the relative abundance of 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequencing data with cell-count abundance data retrieved from the microscope images of the same samples showed a good agreement in bacterial composition. Microbial communities were heterogeneous, with direct spatial relationships between bacteria, cyanobacteria and eukaryotes such as diatoms but also micro-metazoa. Our research provides a valuable resource to investigate biofilm development, succession and associations between specific microscopic taxa at micrometre scales.},

Beach debris was classiﬁed according to material type (e.g., polystyrene) and item use (e.g., ﬁshing). Geophysical features (substrate type, beach direction, and human accessibility) of sample sites were recorded in order to investigate their relationship with debris density. Results suggest the density of macro debris (items {\textgreater} 5 mm) is highest on uninhabited, sandy beaches facing a leeward direction. Higher debris quantities on inaccessible beaches may be due to less frequent beach clean ups. Frequently accessed beaches exhibited lower macro, but higher micro debris (items 1–5 mm) densities, possibly due to removal of macro debris during frequent beach clean ups. This suggests that while geophysical features have some inﬂuence on anthropogenic debris densities, high debris densities are occurring on all islands within the Caribbean region regardless of substrate, beach direction, or human accessibility.},

This study offers an exploratory analysis of data from 1991 to 2016. Schleswig-Holstein exhibited lower mean litter pollution levels than Lower Saxony, possibly because the locations in Lower Saxony are situated along the main coastal current, whereas the North Frisian Islands act as a barrier for the mainland sites in Schleswig-Holstein. Locations close to the Elbe estuary had significantly larger amounts of debris, likely receiving litter from marine and riverine sources. No clear overall pattern in litter abundance or composition could be detected. Significant quantitative similarities between debris types were inconsistent. The effect of wind, tides, and exposure appeared to be marginal. Recurring data inconsistencies, gaps, and outliers were partly attributed to human error.

The potential toxicological effects of plastic-sorbed pollutants in marine organisms have not been thoroughly assessed. In this study, organic extracts from four types of plastic deployed for 9 or 12 months in San Diego Bay, California, were examined for their potential to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ({AhR}) pathway by use of the H4IIE-luc assay. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ({PAH}), including the 16 priority {PAHs}, were quantified. The {AhR}-mediated potency in the deployed plastic samples, calculated as bio-{TEQ} values, ranged from 2.7 pg/g in polyethylene terephthalate ({PET}) to 277 pg/g in low-density polyethylene ({LDPE}). Concentrations of the sum of 24 {PAHs} in the deployed samples ranged from 4.6 to 1068 ng/g. By use of relative potency factors ({REP}), a potency balance between the biological effect (bio-{TEQs}) and the targeted {PAHs} (chem-{TEQs}) was calculated to 24–170\%. The study reports, for the first time, in vitro {AhR}-mediated potencies for different deployed plastics, of which {LDPE} elicited the greatest concentration of bio-{TEQs} followed by polypropylene ({PP}), {PET}, and polyvinylchloride ({PVC}).},

In this study, long-term time series of marine litter abundance on the seaﬂoor and on the coast, both from the southeastern North Sea, were analyzed for temporal trends and correlations. On four beach sections of 100 m length, mean abundances of total beach litter collected four times a year from 2002 to 2008 varied between 105 and 435 items. Mean densities of total inorganic litter on the seaﬂoor amounted to 10.6 ± 9.7 kg {kmÀ}2 in the offshore region (2001e2010) and 13.7 ± 12.6 kg {kmÀ}2 in the Wadden Sea (1998e2007), respectively. In the offshore region, there was no signiﬁcant long-term trend, while in the Wadden Sea, densities of marine litter declined signiﬁcantly. Correlations between time series were weak, indicating different sources and transport processes responsible for compositions of beach litter and litter on the seaﬂoor. Decreases in inputs from ﬁsheries and substantial export due to resuspension are discussed as reasons for the decrease in litter on the seaﬂoor in the Wadden Sea.},

In order to assess the magnitude of the problem and measure changes in abundance, the results of two beach litter monitoring programmes were compared and analysed for long-term trends applying multivariate techniques. Total beach litter pollution was persistently high. Spatial differences in litter abundance made it difﬁcult to identify long-term trends: Partly more than 8000 litter items {yearÀ}1 were recorded on a 100 m long survey site on the island of Scharho€rn, while the survey site on the beach on the island of Amrum revealed abundances lower by two orders of magnitude. Beach litter was dominated by plastic with mean proportions of 52\%e91\% of total beach litter. Non-parametric time series analyses detected many signiﬁcant trends, which, however, did not show any systematic spatial patterns. Cluster analyses partly led to groupings of beaches according to their expositions to sources of litter, wind and currents. Surveys in short intervals of one to two weeks were found to give higher annual sums of beach litter than the quarterly surveys of the {OSPAR} method. Surveys at regular intervals of four weeks to ﬁve months would make monitoring results more reliable.},

	abstract = {Marine litter pollution is a global environmental problem. Beach litter is a part of this problem, and is widely monitored in Europe. The European Marine Strategy Framework Directive ({MSFD}) requires a reduction of beach litter. A reduction of 30\% has been proposed in the European Plastics Strategy. The aims of this study are to develop (a) a method to calculate sufﬁciently stable and precise baseline values for beach litter, and (b) to derive a method of power analysis to estimate the number of beach litter surveys, necessary to detect a given reduction, using these baseline values. Beach litter data from the {OSPAR} (Oslo Paris Convention) region were used, and tailor-made statistical methods were implemented in open source software, {litteR}. Descriptive statistics and Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall trend analyses were calculated for the most abundant beach litter types, for 14 survey sites. The length of a baseline period necessary to obtain a speciﬁed precision of the mean baseline value, expressed as Coefﬁcient of Variation ({CV}), was calculated. Power analyses were performed using Monte Carlo simulations combined with Wilcoxon tests to determine signiﬁcant deviations of the simulated datasets from the baseline mean values. For most survey sites, the mean length of monitoring periods necessary to achieve a {CV} {\textless} 10\% amounts to four to ﬁve years with four surveys a year. The mean number of surveys necessary to detect a statistically signiﬁcant reduction of 30\% with 80\% power ranges from 14 to 20. Power analyses show that a reduction of 10\% is difﬁcult to detect, because more than 24 surveys are needed. In contrary, a reduction of 40e50\% can be detected easily with a small ({\textless}12) number of surveys. The new methods could also be applied to other areas where similar beach litter surveys are performed.},

	abstract = {Plastic marine debris pollution is rapidly becoming one of the critical environmental concerns facing wildlife in the 21st century. Here we present a risk analysis for plastic ingestion by sea turtles on a global scale. We combined global marine plastic distributions based on ocean drifter data with sea turtle habitat maps to predict exposure levels to plastic pollution. Empirical data from necropsies of deceased animals were then utilised to assess the consequence of exposure to plastics. We modelled the risk (probability of debris ingestion) by incorporating exposure to debris and consequence of exposure, and included life history stage, species of sea turtle and date of stranding observation as possible additional explanatory factors. Life history stage is the best predictor of debris ingestion, but the best-ﬁt model also incorporates encounter rates within a limited distance from stranding location, marine debris predictions speciﬁc to the date of the stranding study and turtle species. There is no difference in ingestion rates between stranded turtles vs. those caught as bycatch from ﬁshing activity, suggesting that stranded animals are not a biased representation of debris ingestion rates in the background population. Oceanic life-stage sea turtles are at the highest risk of debris ingestion, and olive ridley turtles are the most at-risk species. The regions of highest risk to global sea turtle populations are off of the east coasts of the {USA}, Australia and South Africa; the east Indian Ocean, and Southeast Asia. Model results can be used to predict the number of sea turtles globally at risk of debris ingestion. Based on currently available data, initial calculations indicate that up to 52\% of sea turtles may have ingested debris.},

We ﬁnd that invasion risks vary widely between coastal ecosystems and classify marine ecoregions according to their total invasion risk and the diversity of their invasion sources. Thereby, we identify high-risk invasion routes, hot spots of bioinvasion and major source regions from which bioinvasion is likely to occur. Our predictions agree with observations in the ﬁeld and reveal that the invasion probability is highest for intermediate geographic distances between donor and recipient ports. Our ﬁndings suggest that network-based invasion models may serve as a basis for the development of effective, targeted bioinvasion management strategies.},

In the present study, we examined the encrusting assemblage on different types of stranded debris (wood, plastic, glass, and metal cans) along the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf. In total, 21 taxa were identiﬁed on 132 items. The average frequency of occurrence (±{SE}) across all sites and stranded debris showed that the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite (68.9 ± 1.1\%), the oyster Saccostrea cucullata (40.9 ± 0.7\%), the polychaete Spirobranchus kraussii (27.3 ± 0.5\%), green algae (22 ± 0.5\%) and the coral Paracyathus stokesii (14.4 ± 0.7\%) occurred most frequently. Relative substratum coverage was highest for A. amphitrite (44.3 ± 2.7\%), followed by green algae (14.4 ± 1.5\%), Spirobranchus kraussii (9.3 ± 1.3\%), Saccostrea cucullata (7.6 ± 1.3\%) and the barnacle Microeuraphia permitini (5.8 ± 0.9\%). Despite the signiﬁcant difference in coverage of rafting species on plastic items among different sites, there was no clear and consistent trend of species richness and coverage from the eastern (Strait of Hormuz) to the western part of the Persian Gulf. Some rafting species (bryozoans and likely barnacles) were found to be non-indigenous species in the area. As ﬂoating marine debris can transport nonindigenous species and increase the risk of bio-invasions to this already naturally- and anthropogenically-stressed water body, comprehensive monitoring efforts should be made to elucidate the vectors and arrival of new invasive species to the region.},

Nowadays, the environmental distribution, sources, and analysis methods and technologies of micro(nano)plastics have been well studied and recognized. Nevertheless, the role of micro(nano)plastic particles as vectors for attaching organisms is not fully understood. In this paper, the role of micro(nano)plastics as vectors, and their potential eﬀects on the ecology are introduced. Micro(nano)plastics could 1) accelerate the diﬀusion of organisms in the environment, which may result in biological invasion; 2) increase the gene exchange between attached bioﬁlm communities, causing the transfer of pathogenic and antibiotic resistance genes; 3) enhance the rate of energy, material and information ﬂow in the environment. Accordingly, the role of microplastics as vectors for organisms should be further evaluated in the future research.},

We investigated the amount of marine litter on the deep-sea bottom around the Ryukyu Islands in the Northwest Pacific, based on trawl samples. The density of litter observed in the axis of the Ryukyu Trench (7100 m) and in the basin of the Okinawa Trough ranged from 1.2 × 103 to 7.1 × 103 items km−2, or 7.5–121.4 kg km−2, which was significantly higher than that observed on the adjacent shallower continental slopes or abyssal plain (0.1 × 103 to 0.6 × 103 items km−2; 0.03–9.2 kg km−2). This suggests that trenches and troughs function as “depocenters” for anthropogenic litter because of their deeper and enclosed topographies.},

This feature attracts tourists tripling their population during holidays, causing increase in the amount of debris on beaches and waters endangering marine biodiversity. To evaluate the amount of solid waste found on beaches in two diﬀerent holiday period, eight people in each beach collected macrodebris (≥2 cm) in a transect covering an 20 m wide area, during 20 min, in winter/2015 and summer/2017. The materials were weighed, quantiﬁed and characterized. In the summer, when the number of tourists is greater, a larger total amount of waste in units were found. Plastic and cigarette butts were the most abundant. The results show that the city does not have adequate planning to receive a large amount of tourists, being vulnerable to socioeconomic and environmental damages.},

Plastic debris with high coliform contents were found, while their respective water samples had only low titers. No correlations were observed, however, between the amounts of bacteria and the chemical compositions of the plastic debris. Forty-four bacterial strains were {PCR}-conﬁrmed as E. coli pathotypes, and 59 strains of Vibrio spp. (with 12 being identiﬁed as Vibrio cholerae [6], Vibrio vulniﬁcus [5], and Vibrio mimicus [1]).

The worst affected, 50-m stretch of shore was estimated to contain {\textgreater}37.000 items with a combined weight of 889 kg. Consistent with studies elsewhere, plastics comprised by far the majority of debris across all sites (89.7\%). The lack of centralised waste collection and limited village-based resources, coupled with an increasing population, suggests that this issue is a long way from solution. High debris loads thwart attempts to rehabilitate depleted mangrove forests through smothering of seedlings, perpetuating run-off and water quality issues in the bay. Addressing marine debris is thus of fundamental importance for the sustainability of Bootless Bay and its resources, and a critical step in promoting ecosystem resilience.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees are used to analyze and visualize evolution. However, trees can be imperfect datatypes when summarizing multiple trees. This is especially problematic when accommodating for biological phenomena such as horizontal gene transfer, incomplete lineage sorting, and hybridization, as well as topological conflict between datasets. Additionally, researchers may want to combine information from sets of trees that have partially overlapping taxon sets. To address the problem of analyzing sets of trees with conflicting relationships and partially overlapping taxon sets, we introduce methods for aligning, synthesizing and analyzing rooted phylogenetic trees within a graph, called a tree alignment graph ({TAG}). The {TAG} can be queried and analyzed to explore uncertainty and conflict. It can also be synthesized to construct trees, presenting an alternative to supertrees approaches. We demonstrate these methods with two empirical datasets. In order to explore uncertainty, we constructed a {TAG} of the bootstrap trees from the Angiosperm Tree of Life project. Analysis of the resulting graph demonstrates that areas of the dataset that are unresolved in majority-rule consensus tree analyses can be understood in more detail within the context of a graph structure, using measures incorporating node degree and adjacency support. As an exercise in synthesis (i.e., summarization of a {TAG} constructed from the alignment trees), we also construct a {TAG} consisting of the taxonomy and source trees from a recent comprehensive bird study. We synthesized this graph into a tree that can be reconstructed in a repeatable fashion and where the underlying source information can be updated. The methods presented here are tractable for large scale analyses and serve as a basis for an alternative to consensus tree and supertree methods. Furthermore, the exploration of these graphs can expose structures and patterns within the dataset that are otherwise difficult to observe.},

By developing standardised protocols and providing training in their application, we worked with .300 volunteer divers from 11 underwater research groups to document the scale of the subtidal marine debris problem at 120 sites across .1000 km of the coast of {NSW}, Australia. Sampling consisted of replicated 2565 m transects in which all debris was identified, counted, and, where appropriate, removed. Sites ranged from estuarine settings adjacent to major population centres, to offshore islands within marine parks. Estuaries and embayments were consistently found to be the most contaminated habitats. Fishing-related items (and especially monofilament and braided fishing line) were most prevalent at the majority of sites, although food and drink items were important contributors at sites adjacent to population centres. The results identified damaging interactions between marine debris and marine biota at some key locations, highlighting the need for management intervention to ensure habitat sustainability. This study reinforces the important contribution that volunteers can make to assessing conservation issues requiring broad-scale data collection. In this case, citizen scientists delivered data that will inform, and help to prioritise, management approaches at both statewide and local scales. These initial data also provide an important baseline for longer-term, volunteer-based monitoring programs.},

Marine debris is a threat to both these natural values and to Island wildlife, and is consequently an important issue for managers. Engaging with volunteers, we quantiﬁed marine debris at 16 beach sites around the Island. The highest loads occurred on the {SW} coast and primarily comprised items originating from ﬁshing activities. Sites on the {NE} coast, where {\textgreater}95\% of the Island’s accommodation is located, supported the highest abundance of items deposited in situ (e.g. bottles and cigarette butts). We conclude that marine debris management may require a range of strategies to address the different primary sources. Raising awareness through education and intervention may be highly effective at popular beaches on the {NE} coast, but broader liaison with commercial and recreational ﬁshers will be necessary to address the issue at the Island scale.},

	abstract = {Marine debris is a global issue with impacts on marine organisms, ecological processes, aesthetics and economies. Consequently, there is increasing interest in quantifying the scale of the problem. Accumulation rates of debris on beaches have been advocated as a useful proxy for at-sea debris loads. However, here we show that past studies may have vastly underestimated the quantity of available debris because sampling was too infrequent. Our study of debris on a small beach in eastern Australia indicates that estimated daily accumulation rates decrease rapidly with increasing intervals between surveys, and the quantity of available debris is underestimated by 50\% after only 3 days and by an order of magnitude after 1 month. As few past studies report sampling frequencies of less than a month, estimates of the scale of the marine debris problem need to be critically re-examined and scaled-up accordingly. These results reinforce similar, recent work advocating daily sampling as a standard approach for accurate quantification of available debris in coastal habitats. We outline an alternative approach whereby site-specific accumulation models are generated to correct bias when daily sampling is impractical.},

Fibreglass reinforced plastic ({FRP}) and epoxy paint was coated over chromated copper arsenate ({CCA}) treated rubber wood panels and exposed in Cochin estuary for 18 months. Total wet weight biomass and numerical abundance of ﬁve most abundant group of foulers viz. hydroids, polychaetes, crustaceans including wood borers, barnacles and bivalves on these panels were studied. Copper, chromium and arsenic concentration in tissues and shells of barnacles were also analyzed. Results indicated signiﬁcantly high biomass and numerical abundance of foulers on physically protected panels than untreated and preservative treated ones. Physical barriers signiﬁcantly reduced accumulation of metals in barnacles indicating possibility of reduced leaching. Study can be considered as a lean to the impact studies conducted world over regarding the use of {CCA} for marine applications. However, {CCA} treated rubber wood as core material for {FRP} boats can be a better option as it poses less adverse effect on organisms in the vicinity.},

	abstract = {Coarse woody debris ({CWD}) in the intertidal region of rocky shores serves as a potential source of nutrients as well as habitat or refugia from predation, ecologically linking the adjacent marine and terrestrial habitats. In a series of ﬁeld and laboratory experiments, the afﬁnity of slowmoving motile intertidal gastropods to {CWD} either as food source or as shelter that increases habitat complexity was tested. In intertidal pools, {CWD} did not increase colonization by Littorina spp., while it did so in supratidal pools. Habitat complexity, brought about by algal cover and barnacles, was apparently sufﬁcient in intertidal pools without woody debris, while the increase in habitat complexity by {CWD} increased the attractiveness of supratidal pools with little natural complexity to Littorina spp. Overall, however, comparison of pools containing woody debris and those containing artiﬁcial shelter provided evidence for {CWD}, and/or its bioﬁlm, serving as food source rather than refugium per se. Similarly, Tegula funebralis chose {CWD} as food source rather than as shelter as indicated by comparison of autoclaved and unmanipulated woody debris. Further, both unfed and fed snails from a site where {CWD} was present signiﬁcantly preferred {CWD} over macroalgae. Among snails from a site without woody debris, fed individuals showed no preference, while unfed snails signiﬁcantly preferred macroalgae. From this, experience appears to be a factor that mediates the role of {CWD}. Overall, however, {CWD} appears to provide supplementary food to snails in the inter- and supratidal zone.},

Plastic litter was further subdivided in 3 sub-categories based on its source: ﬁshing nets, aquaculture nets and other. Plastic was dominant in terms of weight followed by metal and other categories. The highest concentration of litter was found close to the coast likely as a consequence of high coastal urbanization, river inﬂow and extensive navigation associated with the morphological and hydrological features of the basin.},

Here we present results from a ship-based visual survey carried out in the North-Western part of the Black Sea, providing the ﬁrst preliminary data on the characteristics of ﬂoating debris in Romanian waters. High litter densities peaking to 135.9 items/km2 were found in the study area (mean 30.9 ± 7.4 items/km2). Probably due to the proximity of the Danube delta, natural debris were on average, much more abundant than anthropogenic litter in most surveyed locations (mean 141.4 ± 47.1 items/km2, max 1131.3 items/km2). Most of the 225 objects we sighted consisted of pieces of wood and other riparian debris (75.5\%), however plastic items remained undoubtedly the most abundant type of litter, representing 89.1\% of all sighted man-made items. The Black Sea is not exempt from the global invasion of ﬂoating debris, however data are still lacking and a basinwide survey is urgently needed to identify accumulation areas and develop regionally effective solutions to the problem of marine litter.},

Urbanization eﬀects on physicochemical metrics ({pH} and dissolved oxygen) were not signiﬁcant. The coliforms concentration was below the established limit for primary contact, but it was signiﬁcantly higher on beaches with highest recreational potential. Similarly, the abundance of solid waste was signiﬁcantly higher in urbanized areas ({\textasciitilde} 4.5 items/m2), and it was higher than what was found for 106 beaches worldwide. Plastic represented 84\% of the total number of items and recreational activities were the main sources of debris (80\%). Therefore, a balance between recreation and conservation actions, based on short-term (e.g. ﬁnes) and long-term measures (e.g. educational policies) is recommended. We demonstrate that the use of multiple metrics provides more robust estimates of the environmental quality of sandy beaches than a single impact metric.},

Polymers were exposed to two different salinities (i.e. 0 and 35 g/kg), {UV} radiation and turbulence. Additives (e.g. bisphenol A, phthalates, citrates, and Irgafos® 168 phosphate) and oligomers were detected in initial plastics and aqueous extracts. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation was performed by {GC}–{FID}/{MS}. Bisphenol A and citrate based additives are leached easier compared to phthalates. The print highly contributed to the chemical burden of the analyzed polyethylene bag. The study underlines a positive relationship between turbulence and magnitude of leaching. Salinity had a minor impact that differs for each analyte. Global annual release of additives from assessed plastics into marine environments is estimated to be between 35 and 917 tons, of which most are derived from plasticized polyvinylchloride. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Relationships between range dynamics and intrinsic species traits may be particularly apparent in the ocean, where temperature more directly shapes species’ distributions. Here, we test for a role of species traits and climate velocity in driving range extensions in the ocean-warming hotspot of southeast Australia. Climate velocity explained some variation in range shifts, however, including species traits more than doubled the variation explained. Swimming ability, omnivory and latitudinal range size all had positive relationships with range extension rate, supporting hypotheses that increased dispersal capacity and ecological generalism promote extensions. We ﬁnd independent support for the hypothesis that species with narrow latitudinal ranges are limited by factors other than climate. Our ﬁndings suggest that small-ranging species are in double jeopardy, with limited ability to escape warming and greater intrinsic vulnerability to stochastic disturbances.},

	abstract = {Plastics are persistent synthetic polymers that accumulate as waste in the marine environment. Microplastic ({MP}) particles are derived from the breakdown of larger debris or can enter the environment as microscopic fragments. Because filter-feeder organisms ingest {MP} while feeding, they are likely to be impacted by {MP} pollution. To assess the impact of polystyrene microspheres (micro-{PS}) on the physiology of the Pacific oyster, adult oysters were experimentally exposed to virgin micro-{PS} (2 and 6 µm in diameter; 0.023 mg·L
              −1
              ) for 2 mo during a reproductive cycle. Effects were investigated on ecophysiological parameters; cellular, transcriptomic, and proteomic responses; fecundity; and offspring development. Oysters preferentially ingested the 6-µm micro-{PS} over the 2-µm-diameter particles. Consumption of microalgae and absorption efficiency were significantly higher in exposed oysters, suggesting compensatory and physical effects on both digestive parameters. After 2 mo, exposed oysters had significant decreases in oocyte number (−38\%), diameter (−5\%), and sperm velocity (−23\%). The D-larval yield and larval development of offspring derived from exposed parents decreased by 41\% and 18\%, respectively, compared with control offspring. Dynamic energy budget modeling, supported by transcriptomic profiles, suggested a significant shift of energy allocation from reproduction to structural growth, and elevated maintenance costs in exposed oysters, which is thought to be caused by interference with energy uptake. Molecular signatures of endocrine disruption were also revealed, but no endocrine disruptors were found in the biological samples. This study provides evidence that micro-{PS} cause feeding modifications and reproductive disruption in oysters, with significant impacts on offspring.},

	abstract = {This work sheds light on the physicochemical changes of naturally weathered polymer surfaces along with changes of polymer buoyancy due to bioﬁlm formation and degradation processes. To support the degradation hypothesis, a microcosm experiment was conducted where a mixture of naturally weathered plastic pieces was incubated with an indigenous pelagic community. A series of analyses were employed in order to describe the alteration of the physicochemical characteristics of the polymer ({FTIR}, {SEC} and {GPC}, sinking velocity) as well as the bioﬁlm community ({NGS}). At the end of phase {II}, the fraction of double bonds in the surface of microbially treated {PE} ﬁlms increased while changes were also observed in the proﬁle of the {PS} ﬁlms. The molecular weight of {PE} pieces increased with incubation time reaching the molecular weight of the virgin pieces (230,000 g mol−1) at month 5 but the buoyancy displayed no diﬀerence throughout the experimental period. The numberaverage molecular weight of {PS} pieces decreased (33\% and 27\% in {INDG} and {BIOG} treatment respectively), implying chain scission; accelerated (by more than 30\%) sinking velocities compared to the initial weathered pieces were also measured for {PS} ﬁlms with bioﬁlm on their surface. The orders Rhodobacterales, Oceanospirillales and Burkholderiales dominated the distinct platisphere communities and the genera Bacillus and Pseudonocardia discriminate these assemblages from the planktonic counterpart. The functional analysis predicts overrepresentation of adhesive cells carrying xenobiotic and hydrocarbon degradation genes. Taking these into account, we can suggest that tailored marine consortia have the ability to thrive in the presence of mixtures of plastics and participate in their degradation.},

However, due to the presence of glitter-based research in forensic science, we explore the idea that glitter may have the potential to act as “ﬂag items” - or markers – of a likely source, due to the often complex and individual composition of glitter particles compared to traditional microplastics, such as microbeads. As such, this article demonstrates glitter has insofar been overlooked as a microplastic particle, and demonstrates that glitter may have an important role in explaining microplastic pollution dynamics from source to sink.},

We deployed arrays of settlement plates (“settlement arrays”) containing combinations of treatments that reﬂected conditions associated with the vessel transport pathway (i.e., copper based antifouling coatings, shaded habitat) to determine the treatment combinations that maximised {NIMS} diversity. Horizontal (shaded) treatments preferentially sampled higher {NIS} diversity than vertical plates. Although plates with copper-based biocides had larger proportions of {NIS} to indigenous species, they sampled only a subset of {NIS} diversity. Overall diversity was greatly enhanced through use of multiple treatments, demonstrating beneﬁts of multi-faceted sampling arrays for maximising the potential taxonomic and species richness.},

Microplastic contamination in the South Funen Archipelago (0.07 ± 0.02 particles/m3) is slightly below values reported before. The sheltered position of the study area, low population pressure on adjacent islands and the absence of any major potential point sources were identiﬁed as major factors explaining the low concentration of microplastics. Within the Archipelago, harbors or marinas and the associated vessel traﬃc are the most probable sources of microplastics. The concentration of microplastics in low-volume bulk samples is not comparable to manta trawl results. This is mainly due to insuﬃcient representativeness of the bulk sample volumes.},

However, mitigation strategies are limited by the lack of information on the accumulation patterns of these pollutants both at sea and in marine wildlife. Using observations from an uninhabited island in Delta du Saloum National Park, Senegal, we investigate here the prevalence and abundance of debris in nests of two sympatric seabird species, Caspian terns Hydroprogne caspia and great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo, and its potential as an indicator of ocean pollution. We recorded debris in 15\% of the Caspian terns' nests, and 40\% of the great cormorants' nests. Plastics accounted for {\textgreater} 95\% of items recorded in the nests of both species. Caspian terns collected a diverse array of debris, both in terms of types and colours, with a preference for hard plastics and white items. The great cormorants accumulated in nests mainly greenish fishing gears resembling the vegetation typically used as nest materials. Nests of both bird species contained soft plastic in proportions lower than those observed in the environment. Our results suggest that nests of Caspian terns and great cormorants are not useful indicators of pollution by anthropogenic debris in the surrounding waters of the Delta du Saloum National Park. Nests of great cormorants, however, have the potential to indicate areas vulnerable to plastic pollution associated to fishery. The high amount of debris in nests of this species demonstrates the need for a better implementation of waste management strategies in Senegal.},

The site was revisited by {ROV} in March 2011. Analyses of sediment samples and high-deﬁnition video indicate that faunal assemblages on the container’s exterior and the seabed within 10 m of the container differed signiﬁcantly from those up to 500 m. The container surface provides hard substratum for colonization by taxa typically found in rocky habitats. However, some key taxa that dominate rocky areas were absent or rare on the container, perhaps related to its potential toxicity or limited time for colonization and growth.

This reﬂects fundamental knowledge gaps in the transformation, fragmentation, and fates of microplastics in the ocean. In order to better understand microplastic fragmentation we proceeded to a thorough physicochemical characterization of samples collected from the North Artlantic subtropical gyre during the sea campaign Expedition seventh Continent in May 2014. The results were confronted with a mathematical approach. The introduction of mass distribution in opposition to the size distribution commonly proposed in this area clarify the fragmentation pattern. The mathematical analysis of the mass distribution points out a lack of debris with mass lighter than 1 mg. Characterization by means of microscopy, microtomography, and infrared microscopy gives a better understanding of the behavior of microplastic at sea. Flat pieces of debris (2 to 5 mm in length) typically have one face that is more photodegraded (due to exposure to the sun) and the other with more bioﬁlm, suggesting that they ﬂoat in a preferred orientation. Smaller debris, with a cubic shape (below 2 mm), seems to roll at sea. All faces are evenly photodegraded and they are less colonized. The breakpoint in the mathematical model and the experimental observation around 2 mm leads to the conclusion that there is a discontinuity in the rate of fragmentation: we hypothesized that the smaller microplastics, the cubic ones mostly, are fragmented much faster than the parallelepipeds.},

The marine litter density ranged from 0.03 to 0.58 with a mean ( ± {SD}) of 0.16 ± 0.02 items/m2 by count. Based on weight, it varied between 0.44 and 14.74 g/m2 with 3.35 ± 1.63. The east side had a higher marine litter density than the west side with signiﬁcant diﬀerences between beaches. The variations due to diﬀerent seasons were not signiﬁcant for any beach.

	volume = {503},
	abstract = {Rafting on biotic and abiotic substrata has been reported for many benthic marine invertebrates. Here, I describe important characteristics of common ﬂoating substrata and review published studies examining the succession of the assemblage on detached macroalgae to identify the most important factors determining this succession. Floating substrata differ in survival time (i.e. before they disintegrate) and in food value, with abiotic materials having high survival times but low food value and some biotic substrata (seagrasses, fresh wood) having high food values but short survival times. Large macroalgae with pneumatocysts may combine high survival times and high food values. Substratum survival and food value have consequences for the species composition of the rafting macrofauna. In general, suspension feeders dominate rafting assemblages on abiotic substrata, while grazing and boring species abound on macroalgae and wood. The succession of the rafting assemblage can be subdivided into three phases during which different processes predominate. During the initial phase some of the original colonizers (if present) disappear from the substratum, either due to active emigration or predation. This short, initial phase is followed immediately by the colonization phase, during which new organisms colonize the rafting substratum. Colonization may be rapid and intense in the beginning but then slows down. Towards the end of the colonization phase, some rafting organisms may reproduce and their offspring recruit within the parental raft. Results from two long-term studies conﬁrmed that the proportion of species with direct development increased with duration of rafting. These successional changes will be most pronounced for large biotic substrata, rendering these particularly suitable for long-distance dispersal of organisms with direct development.},

	abstract = {Floating objects facilitate the dispersal of marine and terrestrial species but also represent a major environmental hazard in the case of anthropogenic plastic litter. They can be found throughout the world's oceans but information on their abundance and the spatio-temporal dynamics is scarce for many regions of the world. This information, however, is essential to evaluate the ecological role of ﬂoating objects. Herein, we report the results from a ship-based visual survey on the abundance and composition of ﬂotsam in the German Bight (North Sea) during the years 2006 to 2008. The aim of this study was to identify potential sources of ﬂoating objects and to relate spatio-temporal density variations to environmental conditions. Three major ﬂotsam categories were identiﬁed: buoyant seaweed (mainly fucoid brown algae), natural wood and anthropogenic debris. Densities of these ﬂoating objects in the German Bight were similar to those reported from other coastal regions of the world. Temporal variations in ﬂotsam densities are probably the result of seasonal growth cycles of seaweeds and ﬂuctuating river runoff (wood). Higher abundances were often found in areas where coastal fronts and eddies develop during calm weather conditions. Accordingly, ﬂotsam densities were often higher in the inner German Bight than in areas farther offshore. Import of ﬂoating objects and retention times in the German Bight are inﬂuenced by wind force and direction. Our results indicate that a substantial amount of ﬂoating objects is of coastal origin or introduced into the German Bight from western source areas such as the British Channel. Rapid transport of ﬂoating objects through the German Bight is driven by strong westerly winds and likely facilitates dispersal of associated organisms and gene ﬂow among distant populations.},

No seasonal pattern in {AMD} densities was found, but there was a trend of increasing densities over the entire study period. While plastics and Styrofoam were the most common types of {AMD} both on shores and in coastal waters, {AMD} composition differed slightly between the two environments. The results suggest that {AMD} from coastal waters are deposited on local shores, which over time accumulate all types of {AMD}. The types and the very low percentages of {AMD} with epibionts point to mostly local sources. Based on these results, it can be concluded that a reduction of {AMD} will require local solutions.},

The Canary Current upwelling system off the coast of Mauritania and Morocco is the second most productive of the four {EBUS}, where nutrient-­rich waters fuel perennial phytoplankton blooms, evident by high chlorophyll a concentrations off Cape Blanc, Mauritania. High primary production leads to eutrophic waters in the surface layers, whereas sinking phytoplankton debris and horizontally dispersed particles form nepheloid layers ({NLs}) and hypoxic waters at depth. We used Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ({CARD}-­{FISH}) in combination with fatty acid (measured as methyl ester; {FAME}) profiles to investigate the bacterial and archaeal community composition along transects from neritic to pelagic waters within the “giant Cape Blanc filament” in two consecutive years (2010 and 2011), and to evaluate the usage of {FAME} data for microbial community studies. We also report the first fatty acid profile of Pelagibacterales strain {HTCC}7211 which was used as a reference profile for the {SAR}11 clade. Unexpectedly, the reference profile contained low concentrations of long chain fatty acids 18:1 cis11, 18:1 cis11 11methyl, and 19:0 cyclo11–12 fatty acids, the main compounds in other Alphaproteobacteria. Members of the free-­living {SAR}11 clade were found at increased relative abundance in the hypoxic waters in both years. In contrast, the depth profiles of Gammaproteobacteria (including Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas), Bacteroidetes, Roseobacter, and Synechococcus showed high abundances of these groups in layers where particle abundance was high, suggesting that particle attachment or association is an important mechanisms of dispersal for these groups. Collectively, our results highlight the influence of {NLs}, horizontal particle transport, and low oxygen on the structure and dispersal of microbial communities in upwelling systems.},

Although it is recognized as one of the major pollution types for the Black Sea, very few studies can provide quantitative data and there are no data at all on solid wastes of the Black Sea seabed. This study was therefore aimed at investigating the abundance and composition of solid wastes in the southwestern Black Sea. Litter items were collected by trawling in October 2007, and in February and April 2008, at depths ranging from 25 m to 100 m. The solid waste concentration on the seabed showed a large variability (with zones ranging from 128–1320 items km– 2 and 8–217 kg km −2). Marine litter concentrations were higher than in the Mediterranean Sea, consisting mainly of plastic materials. Most items were fragmented, which indicated that they had spent a long time at sea, and this made their identiﬁcation difﬁcult. Only 8 items had legible labels, 2 of them being Turkish and 6 foreign. This suggested that marine litter is a trans-boundary problem, not only in the oceans, but also for enclosed seas like the Black Sea. The situation needs to be monitored all over the basin using standardised methods in order to develop regionally valid and effective solutions.},

Traditional means of species identification and taxonomy of this group encounter numerous challenges, often compounded by the diverse and dynamic nature of shipworm ecology and distribution. Modern integrative taxonomic methods are shedding new light on this complex group, from delineating cryptic species to resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family. This study reported new sequence data from shipworm species rafted from the western to eastern Pacific Ocean in woody marine debris resulting from the Japanese tsunami of 2011. Eight species of shipworms were found in this debris and tissue from five species was collected. Partial nuclear ribosomal 18S {rRNA} gene sequences were obtained from Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Psiloteredo sp., Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928), and Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927). A 658 base pair fragment of {COI} was successfully sequenced from Psiloteredo sp. and T. princesae specimens from tsunami debris, as well as Psiloteredo megotara (Hanley, 1848) from Europe and Nototeredo norvagica (Spangler, 1792) from Scandinavia. Psiloteredo sp. is very similar morphologically to the North Atlantic Ocean P. megotara; however, these two species are genetically distinct with a 12.8\% K2P distance in their {COI} sequences. The transport of shipworms across the North Pacific Ocean in woody debris generated by a tsunami shows that major geologic events can connect previously isolated geographic areas and provide the opportunity for the establishment of invasive species and subsequent speciation.},

When considering exposure to the predominant westerly winds over Scotland, litter loadings on the west coast (i.e. predominant onshore winds) were greater on foreshores on open coasts compared to those within embayments. The opposite was true for the Scottish east coast (i.e. predominantly oﬀshore winds). The north east coast of the {UK} appeared to have an organised pattern of plastic litter loading, increasing in magnitude (median) and spread (inter quartile range) in the direction of the coastal ﬂow.

In addition, it is a critical issue with significant implications from an ecological point of view, as well as for human health and safety. The present study provides a focus concerning the mega-litter in a semi-enclosed basin, the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Southern Italy, Ionian Sea). In this basin, characterized by a suite of anthropic impacts, a specific protocol for the mega-litter removal has been developed according to the Special Commissioner for remediation of the Site of National Interest of Taranto. The application of such protocol proved to be effective in limiting the removals’ secondary effects on the biodiversity and on the environment as a whole, allowing a sustainable removal of marine mega-litter. A critical part of such protocol resulted in the translocation of species of conservation interest present on the debris, particularly considering the rich population of the pen shell Pinna nobilis thriving in the area. A total of 7107 specimens were translocated, showing low mortality percentage and high survival rates during 9 months of monitoring.},

While P. minutus was recorded from inanimate ﬂotsam outside of the Mediterranean, L. navigator is herein reported for the ﬁrst time on ﬂoating marine litter. The role of ﬂoating litter as habitat or as a dispersal agent for marine invertebrates has received quite attention however, records of decapod crabs drifting on litter has been relatively sparse. Our results suggests that vast quantities of ﬂoating debris, comprised primarily of non-biodegradable plastic polymers, probably will augment natural ﬂoating substrates in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species. The dispersion of rafting crabs through ﬂoating debris should be investigated given the high potential ecological risk of invasion by exotic species due to the increase in waste production (ecological risk assessment).},

In 2007, towed-diver surveys were used to identify and count pieces of trap debris and any other marine debris encountered. Trap debris density (debris incidences/ha) in historic trap-use zones and in representative benthic habitats was estimated. Trap debris was not proportionally distributed with ﬁshing effort. Coral habitats had the greatest density of trap debris despite trap ﬁshers’ reported avoidance of coral reefs while ﬁshing. The accumulation of trap debris on coral emphasizes the role of wind in redistributing traps and trap debris in the sanctuary. We estimated that 85,548 ± 23,387 (mean ± {SD}) ghost traps and 1,056,127 ± 124,919 nonﬁshing traps or remnants of traps were present in the study area. Given the large numbers of traps in the ﬁshery and the lack of effective measures for managing and controlling the loss of gear, the generation of trap debris will likely continue in proportion to the number of traps deployed in the ﬁshery. Focused removal of submerged trap debris from especially vulnerable habitats such as reefs and hardbottom, where trap debris density is high, would mitigate key habitat issues but would not address ghost ﬁshing or the cost of lost gear.},

Injuries sustained by S. alterniﬂora and subsequent recovery, varied considerably between debris types. Differences were likely due to dissimilarities in the structure and composition of debris. Tires caused an immediate (within 3 weeks) and long-term impact to S. alterniﬂora; tire footprints remained devoid of vegetation 14 months postremoval. Conversely, crab pot impacts were not as abrupt and recovery was short-term ({\textless}10 months). We suggest that removal programs speciﬁcally target habitats that are susceptible to negative impacts (e.g., salt marsh) and prone to debris accumulation.

It may remain unnoticed until it shows up on coral reefs, beaches and in other coastal habitats. Stony corals have fragile skeletons and soft tissues that can easily become damaged when they get in contact with lost ﬁshing gear. During a dive survey around Koh Tao, a small island in the Gulf of Thailand, the impact of lost ﬁshing gear (nets, ropes, cages, lines) was studied on corals representing six diﬀerent growth forms: branching, encrusting, foliaceous, free-living, laminar, and massive. Most gear ({\textgreater} 95\%) contained plastic. Besides absence of damage ({ND}), three categories of coral damage were assessed: fresh tissue loss ({FTL}), tissue loss with algal growth ({TLAG}), and fragmentation ({FR}). The position of the corals in relation to the ﬁshing gear was recorded as either growing underneath (Un) or on top (On), whereas corals adjacent to the gear (Ad) were used as controls. Nets formed the dominant type of lost gear, followed by ropes, lines and cages, respectively. Branching corals were most commonly found in contact with the gear and also around it. Tubastraea micranthus was the most commonly encountered coral species, either Un, On, or Ad. Corals underneath gear showed most damage, which predominantly consisted of tissue loss. Fragmentation was less common than expected, which may be related to the low fragility of T. micranthus as dominant branching species. Even if nets serve as substrate for corals, it is recommended to remove them from reefs, where they form a major component of the plastic pollution and cause damage to corals and other reef organisms.},

Microplastic concentrations were determined to assess overall abundance in the different marine compartments of the Belgian Continental Shelf. In terms of weight, macrodebris still dominates the pollution of beaches, but in the water column and in the seaﬂoor microplastics appear to be of higher importance: here, microplastic weight is approximately 100 times and 400 times higher, respectively, than macrodebris weight.},

	abstract = {Fulmars are effective biological indicators of the abundance of ﬂoating plastic marine debris. Long-term data reveal high plastic abundance in the southern North Sea, gradually decreasing to the north at increasing distance from population centres, with lowest levels in high-arctic waters. Since the 1980s, pre-production plastic pellets in North Sea fulmars have decreased by {\textasciitilde}75\%, while user plastics varied without a strong overall change. Similar trends were found in net-collected ﬂoating plastic debris in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, with a {\textasciitilde}75\% decrease in plastic pellets and no obvious trend in user plastic. The decreases in pellets suggest that changes in litter input are rapidly visible in the environment not only close to presumed sources, but also far from land. Floating plastic debris is rapidly “lost” from the ocean surface to other as-yet undetermined sinks in the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Microplastic debris ﬂoating at the ocean surface can harm marine life. Understanding the severity of this harm requires knowledge of plastic abundance and distributions. Dozens of expeditions measuring microplastics have been carried out since the 1970s, but they have primarily focused on the North Atlantic and North Paciﬁc accumulation zones, with much sparser coverage elsewhere. Here, we use the largest dataset of microplastic measurements assembled to date to assess the conﬁdence we can have in global estimates of microplastic abundance and mass. We use a rigorous statistical framework to standardize a global dataset of plastic marine debris measured using surface-trawling plankton nets and coupled this with three different ocean circulation models to spatially interpolate the observations. Our estimates show that the accumulated number of microplastic particles in 2014 ranges from 15 to 51 trillion particles, weighing between 93 and 236 thousand metric tons, which is only approximately 1\% of global plastic waste estimated to enter the ocean in the year 2010. These estimates are larger than previous global estimates, but vary widely because the scarcity of data in most of the world ocean, differences in model formulations, and fundamental knowledge gaps in the sources, transformations and fates of microplastics in the ocean.},

We developed the Global Riverine Export of Microplastics into Seas ({GREMiS}) model, a global, spatially explicit model for analysing the annual microplastics export to coastal seas. Our results indicate that riverine microplastics export varies among world regions, with several hotspots, e.g., South East Asia, and, depending on the 2050 scenario, may be doubled (‘Business as usual’) or halved due to improved waste management (‘Environment proﬁts’). Globally, our model simulations indicated fragmentation of macroplastics as the main source of microplastics, but this result heavily depends on the assumed fragmentation rate. Sewerage discharges contributed only 20\%, ranging from 1\% (Africa) to 60\% ({OECD} countries) and decreasing by 2050 as a result of improved sanitation. We conclude that, combating microplastics in the aquatic environment requires more region-speciﬁc analyses.},

The results showed abundance of white-colored and irregular-shaped plastic debris in this study area. Polypropylene was identiﬁed as a dominant polymer variety, followed by polyethylene, polystyrene, nylon, and polyvinyl chloride. Tourist activities and ﬁshing practices were found to be the possible sources of the microplastic debris.

Large debris ({\textgreater}100 cm) was encountered in all marsh habitat types surveyed and was primarily composed of anthropogenic wood and derelict ﬁshing gear.

The distribution, type and abundance of marine litter in Ormonde and Gettysburg, the two seamounts of Gorringe Bank, were analyzed from photo and video imagery obtained during {ROV}-based surveys carried out at 60–3015 m depths during the E/V Nautilus cruise {NA}017. Located approximately 125 nm southwest of Portugal, Gorringe Bank lays at the crossroad between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and is therefore characterized by an intense maritime trafﬁc and ﬁshing activities. The high frequency of lost or discarded ﬁshing gear, such as cables, longlines and nets, observed on Gorringe Bank suggests an origin mostly from ﬁshing activities, with a clear turnover in the type of litter (mostly metal, glass and to a much lesser extent, plastic) with increasing depth. Litter was more abundant at the summit of Gorringe Bank (ca. 4 items·km−1), decreasing to less than 1 item·km−1 at the ﬂanks and to ca. 2 items·km−1 at greater depths. Nevertheless, litter abundance appeared to be lower than in continental margin areas. The results presented herein are a contribution to support further actions for the conservation of vulnerable habitats on Gorringe Bank so that they can continue contributing to ﬁshery productivity in the surrounding region.},

There have been several attempts to develop interdisciplinary approaches to risk that include natural as well as social science contributions. In this paper, the authors aim at developing a social-ecological perspective on risk by drawing on the concept of societal relations to nature and the model of provisioning systems. This perspective is used to analyze four cases, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, semicentralized water infrastructures and forest management, with regard to risk identiﬁcation, assessment and management. Finally, the paper aims at developing a perspective on risks which takes into account non-intended side-effects, system interdependencies and uncertainty.},

Short-term experiments suggested iron is not limiting, yet iron still likely limits nitrogen fixation, and thus production, at longer time scales, as the presence of nitrogen-fixers is exceptionally low compared to other ocean gyres. Plankton function is dominated by the smallest unicellular organisms, picoplankton ({\textless}3 µm in diameter). The {SPSG} represents a center of high biodiversity for picoplankton, as well as heterotrophic organisms such as tinntinids, siphonophores, and possibly amphipods, although data for key zooplankton, such as copepods, are lacking. Many groups exhibit negative relationships between diversity and total plankton biomass. High diversity might result from dispersal from a very large metacommunity and minimal competition within functional groups. Whether an island-mass effect causes a real or apparent increase in plankton biomass around Easter Island must be confirmed by high-resolution sampling in situ. Long-term threats to the planktonic ecosystem may include climate change-enhanced ocean stratification and plastic marine debris accumulation. Finally, priorities for future research are highlighted.},

Optical microscopy enabled morphological classiﬁcation of the types of particles or ﬁbers present in the sample, as well as the quantiﬁcation of particle size ranges and ﬁber lengths. {SEM}/{EDS} analysis was used to rule out non-plastic particles and screen the prepared samples for potential microplastic, based on their element signatures and surface characteristics. Chlorinated plastics such as polyvinyl chloride ({PVC}) could be easily identiﬁed with {SEM}/{EDS} due to their unique elemental signatures including chlorine, as could mineral species that are falsely identiﬁed as plastics by optical microscopy. Particle morphology determined by optical microscopy and {SEM} suggests the ﬁsh ingested particles contained both degradation fragments from larger plastic pieces and also manufactured microplastics. {SEM} images of microplastic particle surfaces revealed characteristic cracks consistent with environmental exposure, as well as pigment particles consistent with manufactured materials. Most of the microplastic surfaces in the ﬁsh guts and ocean trawls were covered with bioﬁlms, radiolarians, and crustaceans. Many of the ﬁsh stomachs contained micro-shell pieces which visually resembled microplastics.},

In this study, we quantiﬁed the level of microplastic pollution at an oﬀshore wind farm in the Yellow Sea, China, in 2016. The abundance of microplastics was 0.330 ± 0.278 items/m3 in the surface water and 2.58 ± 1.14 items/g (dry) in the sediment. To the best of our knowledge, the level of microplastic pollution in our study area was slightly higher than that in coastal areas around the world. The microplastics detected in the surface waters and sediments were mainly ﬁbrous (75.3\% and 68.7\%, respectively) and consisted of some granules and ﬁlms. The microplastics in the samples might originate from garments or ropes via wastewater discharge. The abundance of plastic in the water and sediment samples collected from the wind farm area was lower than that in the samples collected from outside the wind farm area. The anthropogenic hydrodynamic eﬀect was the main factor aﬀecting the local distribution of microplastics. The presence of a wind farm could increase the bed shear stress during ebb tide, disturbing the bed sediment, facilitating its initiation and transport, and ultimately increasing the ease of washing away the microplastics adhered to the sediment. This study will serve as a reference for further studies of the distribution and migration of microplastics in coastal zones subjected to similar marine utilization.},

Orkney has a well-developed infrastructure supporting the marine energy industry; recently enhanced by the construction of additional piers. A major concern to marine industries is biofouling on submerged structures, including energy converters and measurement instrumentation. In this study, the marine energy infrastructure and instrumentation were surveyed to characterise the biofouling. Fouling communities varied between deployment habitats; key species were identified allowing recommendations for scheduling device maintenance and preventing spread of invasive organisms. A method to measure the impact of biofouling on hydrodynamic response is described and applied to data from a wave-monitoring buoy deployed at a test site in Orkney. The results are discussed in relation to the accuracy of the measurement resources for power generation. Further applications are suggested for future testing in other scenarios, including tidal energy.},

The Indian Ocean has been hypothesized as a ‘dispersal corridor’ connecting hydrothermal vent fauna of Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Stalked barnacles of the family Eolepadidae are common associates of deep-sea vents in Southern, Pacific and Indian oceans, and the family is an ideal group for testing this hypothesis. Here, we describe
              Neolepas marisindica
              sp. nov. from the Indian Ocean, distinguished from
              N. zevinae

              N. rapanuii
              by having a tridentoid mandible in which the second tooth lacks small elongated teeth. Morphological variations suggest that environmental differences result in phenotypic plasticity in the capitulum and scales on the peduncle in eolepadids. We suggest that diagnostic characters in Eolepadidae should be based mainly on more reliable arthropodal characters and {DNA} barcoding, while the plate arrangement should be used carefully with their intraspecific variation in mind. We show morphologically that
              Neolepas
              specimens collected from the South West Indian Ridge, the South East Indian Ridge and the Central Indian Ridge belong to the new species. Molecular phylogeny and fossil evidence indicated that
              Neolepas
              migrated from the southern Pacific to the Indian Ocean through the Southern Ocean, providing key evidence against the ‘dispersal corridor’ hypothesis. Exploration of the South East Indian Ridge is urgently required to understand vent biogeography in the Indian Ocean.},

Yet our understanding of spatio-temporal trends in beach litter and the drivers of these trends are currently limited by the availability of robust long term data sets. Here we present a unique data set collected systematically once a month, every month over a six year period for nine beaches along the North Coast of Cornwall, U.K. to investigate the key drivers of beach litter in the Bude, Padstow and Porthcothan areas. Overall, an average of 0.02 litter items {mÀ}2 per month were collected during the six year study, with Bude beaches (Summerleaze, Crooklets and Widemouth) the most impacted (0.03 ± 0.004 litter items {mÀ}2 per month). The amount of litter collected each month decreased by 18\% and 71\% respectively for Padstow (Polzeath, Trevone and Harlyn) and Bude areas over the 6 years, possibly related to the regular cleaning, however litter increased by 120\% despite this monthly cleaning effort on the Padstow area beaches. Importantly, at all nine beaches the litter was dominated by small, fragmented plastic pieces and rope ﬁbres, which account for 32\% and 17\% of all litter items collected, respectively. The weathered nature of these plastics indicates they have been in the marine environment for an extended period of time. So, whilst classifying the original source of these plastics is not possible, it can be concluded they are not the result of recent public littering. This data highlights both the extent of the marine litter problem and that current efforts to reduce littering by beach users will only tackle a fraction of this litter. Such information is vital for developing effective management strategies for beach and marine litter at both regional and global levels.},

Human discards were principally from ships offshore.

In addition to microplastics released during clothes washing, a probable source is polymer ropes in abandoned, lost and discarded ﬁshing and recreational sailing gear. The fragmentation of polypropylene, polyethylene, and nylon exposed to benthic conditions at 10 m depth over 12 months was monitored using changes in weight and tensile properties. Water temperature and light levels were continuously monitored. The degree of biofouling was measured using chlorophyll a, the weight of attached macroalgae, and colonising fauna. Results indicate microplastic ﬁbres and particles may be formed in benthic environments despite reduced photodegradation. Polypropylene, Nylon, and polyethylene lost an average of 0.39\%, 1.02\%, and 0.45\% of their mass per month respectively. Microscope images of the rope surface revealed notable surface roughening believed to be caused by abrasion by substrate and the action of fouling organisms.},

In parallel with numerical tool development, physical component testing utilising realistic load cases is pivotal in achieving a greater understanding of performance variations including the contribution of degradation mechanisms. Building upon previous experimental tests conducted by the authors, tension–tension tests were conducted on a sample used in ﬁrst part of the study and samples extracted from a mooring line which was deployed for 18 months with the South West Mooring Test Facility. In agreement with the ﬁrst part of the study it was found that sample axial stiffness and damping are inﬂuenced by load history and instantaneous strain. The increased compliance, lower load bearing capacity and reduced tension–tension fatigue performance of aged specimens are symptomatic of ﬁbre-on-ﬁbre abrasion damage sustained in service. Visual inspections of the rope and yarns including scanning electron microscope analysis of ﬁbres revealed that abrasion wear was accelerated by debris found within the rope structure, highlighting the importance of preventing particle ingress.

Several trends emerged; plastic composed 69–95\% of debris; there was a signiﬁcant increase in debris accumulation during the spring and summer seasons; accumulation rates were ten times greater in Texas than the other Gulf States throughout the year; and the amount of debris accumulating along the shoreline could be predicted with high conﬁdence in areas with high freshwater inﬂux.},

              Most marine animals have a pelagic larval phase that develops in the coastal or open ocean. The fate of larvae has profound effects on replenishment of marine populations that are critical for human and ecosystem health. Larval ecology is expected to be tightly coupled to oceanic features, but for most taxa we know little about the interactions between larvae and the pelagic environment. Here, we provide evidence that surface slicks, a common coastal convergence feature, provide nursery habitat for diverse marine larvae, including {\textgreater} 100 species of commercially and ecologically important fishes. The vast majority of invertebrate and larval fish taxa sampled had mean densities 2–110 times higher in slicks than in ambient water. Combining in-situ surveys with remote sensing, we estimate that slicks contain 39\% of neustonic larval fishes, 26\% of surface-dwelling zooplankton (prey), and 75\% of floating organic debris (shelter) in our 1000 km
              2
              study area in Hawai‘i. Results indicate late-larval fishes actively select slick habitats to capitalize on concentrations of diverse prey and shelter. By providing these survival advantages, surface slicks enhance larval supply and replenishment of adult populations from coral reef, epipelagic, and deep-water ecosystems. Our findings suggest that slicks play a critically important role in enhancing productivity in tropical marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {No-take marine reserves ({NTMRs}) are increasingly being established to conserve or restore biodiversity and to enhance the sustainability of fisheries. Although effectively designed and protected {NTMR} networks can yield conservation and fishery benefits, reserve effects often fail to manifest in systems where there are high levels of non-compliance by fishers (poaching). Obtaining reliable estimates of {NTMR} non-compliance can be expensive and logistically challenging, particularly in areas with limited or non-existent resources for conducting surveillance and enforcement. Here we assess the utility of density estimates and re-accumulation rates of derelict (lost and abandoned) fishing line as a proxy for fishing effort and {NTMR} non-compliance on fringing coral reefs in three island groups of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park ({GBRMP}), Australia. Densities of derelict fishing line were consistently lower on reefs within old (.20 year) {NTMRs} than on non-{NTMR} reefs (significantly in the Palm and Whitsunday Islands), whereas line densities did not differ significantly between reefs in new {NTMRs} (5 years of protection) and {nonNTMR} reefs. A manipulative experiment in which derelict fishing lines were removed from a subset of the monitoring sites demonstrated that lines reaccumulated on {NTMR} reefs at approximately one third (32.4\%) of the rate observed on non-{NTMR} reefs over a thirty-two month period. Although these inshore {NTMRs} have long been considered some of the best protected within the {GBRMP}, evidence presented here suggests that the level of non-compliance with {NTMR} regulations is higher than previously assumed.},

The sources of this debris vary depending on proximity to urban centres and the nature of activities within an area. This paper examines the inﬂuence of tourism in the southern Great Barrier Reef ({GBR}), and its contribution to litter levels in the region. By conducting beach debris surveys on occupied and unoccupied islands, this study found that debris was prevalent throughout the region with signiﬁcant differences in material types between locations. The greatest source of debris from publically accessible islands was tourist-related, with this source also inﬂuencing debris loads on nearby uninhabited islands. A focus on debris at Heron Island, showed that sites close to amenities had greater levels of tourist-sourced items like cigarette butts. These ﬁndings indicate the contribution of tourists to this problem and that working with operators and managers is needed to minimise visitor impacts.},

Several seabirds include debris items in their nests, which can lead to entanglement of chicks and adults, resulting in injury or death. Anthropogenic debris was found in 4–67\% of kelp gull Larus dominicanus nests in seven colonies in the Western Cape, South Africa. Nests contained two types of litter: items included in the nest structure during construction (mainly ropes and straps), and regurgitated items (mainly bags and food wrappers) that probably accumulate primarily during the chick-rearing period. Debris used in nest construction was more likely to injure gulls, and was found mainly at coastal sites where there was little natural vegetation for construction. Distance to the nearest urban waste landﬁll signiﬁcantly affected the occurrence of debris items in nests, especially dietary-derived items. The amount of debris in kelp gull nests highlights the need for improved debris management in South Africa.},

	abstract = {Marine debris, mostly consisting of plastic, is a global problem, negatively impacting wildlife, tourism and shipping. However, despite the durability of plastic, and the exponential increase in its production, monitoring data show limited evidence of concomitant increasing concentrations in marine habitats. There appears to be a considerable proportion of the manufactured plastic that is unaccounted for in surveys tracking the fate of environmental plastics. Even the discovery of widespread accumulation of microscopic fragments (microplastics) in oceanic gyres and shallow water sediments is unable to explain the missing fraction. Here, we show that deep-sea sediments are a likely sink for microplastics. Microplastic, in the form of fibres, was up to four orders of magnitude more abundant (per unit volume) in deep-sea sediments from the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean than in contaminated sea-surface waters. Our results show evidence for a large and hitherto unknown repository of microplastics. The dominance of microfibres points to a previously underreported and unsampled plastic fraction. Given the vastness of the deep sea and the prevalence of microplastics at all sites we investigated, the deep-sea floor appears to provide an answer to the question—
              where is all the plastic?},

There are no global estimates of benthic litter because of the scarcity of data and only patchy survey coverage. However, estimates of baseline abundance and composition of litter are vital in order to implement litter reduction policies and adequate monitoring schemes. Two large-scale surveys of submarine geomorphological features in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans reveal that litter was found at all locations, despite their remoteness. Litter abundance was patchy, but both surveyed oceans had sites of high litter density. There was a signiﬁcant difference in the type of litter found in the two oceans, with the Indian Ocean sites being dominated by ﬁshing gear, whereas the Atlantic Ocean sites displayed a greater mix of general refuse. This study suggests that seabed litter is ubiquitous on raised benthic features, such as seamounts. It also concludes that the pattern of accumulation and composition of the litter is determined by a complex range of factors both environmental and anthropogenic. We suggest that the tracing of ﬁshing effort and gear type would be an important step to elucidate hotspots of litter abundance on seamounts, ridges and banks.},

Incidental contamination is highly likely unless strict control measures are employed. Here we describe methods developed to minimize the amount of incidental post-sampling contamination when quantifying marine microﬁbre pollution. We show that our protocol, adapted from the ﬁeld of forensic ﬁbre examination, reduces ﬁbre abundance by 90\% and enables the quick screening of ﬁbre populations. These methods therefore allow an accurate estimate of microplastics polluting marine sediments. In a case study from a series of samples collected on a research vessel, we use these methods to highlight the prevalence of microﬁbres as marine microplastics.},

	abstract = {Deciphering the evolution of Southern Ocean circulation during the Eocene and Oligocene has important implications for understanding the development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and transition to Earth’s “icehouse” climate. To better understand ocean circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, we generated a new fossil ﬁsh tooth neodymium isotope record (εNd) from the upper Eocene to upper Oligocene sections (36–23 Ma) of Ocean Drilling Program Sites 744 and 748 (Kerguelen Plateau, Indian Ocean). Reconstructed seawater εNd values from fossil ﬁsh teeth are used to trace changes in water masses across ocean basins. The records from Site 748 and Site 744 reveal a gradual shift from εNd values around À6.5 to À7.5 in the late Eocene to εNd values between À7.5 and À8.3 by the late Oligocene, consistent with a Circumpolar Deep Water ({CDW}) inﬂuence at the Kerguelen Plateau throughout the Oligocene. We interpret the shift to less radiogenic values to reﬂect the increased export of Northern Component Water to the Southern Ocean, likely into the proto-{CDW}. However, the records show no major change in water mass composition around the Kerguelen Plateau that would accompany an increase in Paciﬁc throughﬂow related to the opening of Drake Passage and imply that Paciﬁc throughﬂow via the Drake Passage occurred by the late Eocene. High-frequency variability in ɛNd values at Site 744 is interpreted as an imprint of Oligocene glacial activity, with a particularly pronounced excursion at 32.6 Ma roughly coinciding with other glacial weathering indicators around Antarctica.},

The composition of plastisphere microbial communities varied remarkably across geographical locations and exposure times. The dominant bacteria in the plastisphere were affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria class, particularly Rhodobacteraceae, followed by the Gammaproteobacteria class. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the microplastics showed signs of degradation. Microbial communities showed adaptations to plastisphere including more diverse microbial community and greater “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism” in metabolic pathway analysis. The findings elucidate the long-term changes in the community composition of microorganisms that colonize microplastics and expand the understanding of plastisphere microbial communities present in the marine environment.},

Fouling organisms colonizing the buoys and their mooring systems were sampled after 8 and 12 months of deployment. A total of 86 species was collected and identiﬁed at these two stations and the fouling community showed a typical oceanic characteristics. Most of the species were mainly found in the top 50 m depth and a striking vertical zonation of species was also observed with depth. The distance from offshore is a major factor in determining the fouling community composition. In terms of biomass, the fouling community was dominated by pedunculate barnacles, hydroids, and algae, followed by common oysters, pearl oysters and acorn barnacles. Biomass of hard fouling organisms increased over time.

This is the first analysis of the diversity, abundance, and co-occurrence of {ARGs} and {MRGs}, and their relationships within the microbial community, using metagenomic data of plastic particles observed in the North Pacific Gyre obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database. The abundance of {ARGs} and {MRGs} in microbial communities on the plastics were in the ranges 7.07 × 10−4–1.21 × 10−2 and 5.51 × 10−3–4.82 × 10−2 copies per 16S {rRNA}, respectively. Both the Shannon-Wiener indices and richness of {ARGs} and {MRGs} in plastics microbiota were significantly greater than those of {ARGs} and {MRGs} in seawater microbiota in the North Pacific Gyre via one-way analysis of variance. Multidrug resistance genes and multi-metal resistance genes were the main classes of genes detected in plastic microbiota. There were no significant differences in the abundance or diversity of {ARGs} and {MRGs} between macroplastics biota and microplastics biota, indicating that particle size had no effect on resistance genes. Procrustes analysis suggested that microbial community composition was the determining factor of the {ARG} profile but not for {MRG}. Some {ARGs} and {MRGs} had a higher incidence of non-random co-occurrence, suggesting that the co-effects of selection for antibiotic or metal resistance are important factors influencing the resistome of the microbiota on the plastic particles.},

White and black/grey resin pellets accounted for 11.3\% of the particles collected from Kahuku Beach and 4.2\% of the particles from Kamilo Beach. Plastic type based on Raman Spectrometer analysis of a small representative subsample indicated that most of the fragments were polyethylene and a few were polypropylene.},

	abstract = {Marine litter is a global concern. Since most of the litter sinks, understanding the composition of benthic marine litter is crucial for addressing this concern. However, high costs of seafloor monitoring inhibit such understanding. Consequently, benthic marine litter in the Baltic Sea has not been comprehensively addressed yet. Here we present data from 2377 hauls, which collected 6828 litter items and 2412 kg on the Baltic seafloor during six years of the Baltic International Trawl Survey ({BITS}) by seven nations. Our results show lower percentages of plastic (35\%) than the widely cited world average (70\%) and less fishery-originated litter (2.2–5.6\%) than was previously reported for the Baltic Sea (4–24\%). Natural products, mostly residuals of burnt coal, were identified as the most common litter category (42–57\%) and were largely ignored in the past. Our results highlight the importance of using several evaluation metrics, particularly number of items, weight and encounter probability.},

Results from manta net tows for microplastics revealed an average abundance of 315,009 ± 568,578 items km−2 (217 ± 575 g km−2). We found signiﬁcantly higher microplastics abundances in nearshore (≤4 km) than in oﬀshore waters ({\textgreater} 4 km) and this trend seems to aﬀect also the small sized macro plastic fragments (2.5–5 cm).

	abstract = {Plastics are the most abundant form of marine debris, with global production rising and documented impacts in some marine environments, but the inﬂuence of plastic on open ocean ecosystems is poorly understood, particularly for microbial communities. Plastic marine debris ({PMD}) collected at multiple locations in the North Atlantic was analyzed with scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and next-generation sequencing to characterize the attached microbial communities. We unveiled a diverse microbial community of heterotrophs, autotrophs, predators, and symbionts, a community we refer to as the “Plastisphere”. Pits visualized in the {PMD} surface conformed to bacterial shapes suggesting active hydrolysis of the hydrocarbon polymer. Small-subunit {rRNA} gene surveys identiﬁed several hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, supporting the possibility that microbes play a role in degrading {PMD}. Some Plastisphere members may be opportunistic pathogens (the authors, unpublished data) such as speciﬁc members of the genus Vibrio that dominated one of our plastic samples. Plastisphere communities are distinct from surrounding surface water, implying that plastic serves as a novel ecological habitat in the open ocean. Plastic has a longer half-life than most natural ﬂoating marine substrates, and a hydrophobic surface that promotes microbial colonization and bioﬁlm formation, diﬀering from autochthonous substrates in the upper layers of the ocean.},

An identiﬁcation of the patterns of microplastic distribution will help to understand the scale of their potential effect on the environment and on organisms. In this study, the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the Bohai Sea are reported for the ﬁrst time. We sampled ﬂoating microplastics at 11 stations in the Bohai Sea using a 330 mm trawling net in August 2016. The abundance, composition, size, shape and color of collected debris samples were analyzed after pretreatment. The average microplastic concentration was 0.33 ± 0.34 particles/m3. Micro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that the main types of microplastics were polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. As the size of the plastics decreased, the percentage of polypropylene increased, whereas the percentages of polyethylene and polystyrene decreased. Plastic fragments, lines, and ﬁlms accounted for most of the collected samples. Accumulation at some stations could be associated with transport and retention mechanisms that are linked to wind and the dynamics of the rim current, as well as different sources of the plastics.},

Representative plastics were identified using Raman spectroscopy. Vast amounts of plastic remain in beaches after beach cleaning. Spatial discrepancies in the amounts of plastics were observed, with the greatest quantity observed at Zhuhai and Weizhou Island. Small plastics accounted for 63.4\% of plastic debris quantified by number. Larger plastics ({\textgreater} 20 mm) made up 74.7\% of the total plastic weight. An exponential damping relationship between the size and amount of plastic debris was determined, although it is only of borderline significance (α = 0.05). Plastic shapes were heterogeneous among the beaches. Polypropylene (59.7\%) and polyethylene (31.9\%) were the most common polymer compositions in the selected samples. Coloured and white plastics were more prevalent than black and transparent ones.

In this study, ﬁrstly the general status and sources of marine debris in China were assessed in the time period between 2007 and 2014, and secondly marine debris situation was evaluated in three China Sea Areas (the North China Sea, the East China Sea and the South China Sea) from 2009 to 2013, and ﬁnally marine debris conditions and sources were analyzed in beaches or seawaters around some coastal provinces of China during 2007–2013. Based on above analysis, the primary conclusions were as follows: (1) The mean number and weight densities of beached marine debris ({BMD}) and submerged marine debris ({SMD}) were 4.30, 0.13 items/100 m2 and 133.80, 22.60 g/100 m2 in China from 2007 to 2014, respectively. The average number density of the large size {FMD} ({LOSFMD}) was 0.0024 items/100 m2 and that of the small and medium size {FMD} ({SMSFMD}) was 0.30 items/100 m2, and the mean weight density of the {SMSFMD} was 1.40 g/100 m2 from 2008 to 2014. The {SMD} and {FMD} densities were at the low level and the {BMD} density was at the high level in China. (2) The marine debris primarily was comprised of plastic, Styrofoam, wood, glass, rubber, fabric/ﬁber and metal, which included almost all major categories of marine debris. (3) Sources of {BMD} and {FMD} were as follows: the ﬁrst source was coastal/recreational activities, followed by other disposal sources, navigation/ﬁshing activities and the activities related smoking, and the least source being those associated with medical/sanitary activities, while the source of {SMD} remained unknown. (4) The mean number and weight densities of {BMD} were the biggest in the North China Sea, while those of {FMD} and {SMD} were the highest in the northern South China Sea.

On coastal stations ({\textasciitilde}30 m deep), stratiﬁcation with high ﬁbers content was associated with the proximity of terrestrial sources and estuarine discharges, while on oﬀ-shore stations the variability of {MPs} was related to vertical thermohaline structure. Mean {MPs} content was the 32.2 ({SD} 50.4) pcs/m3. Elevated {MPs} concentrations were observed in subsurface, near-bottom and thermohaline layers compared with intermediate layers.

Liver accumulated higher levels of contaminants than mantle. The sums of {DDTs}, {PCBs}, {CHLs} and {HCHs} in liver were in the ranges of 164–4430 ng {gÀ}1, 95–1030 ng {gÀ}1, 15–121 ng {gÀ}1, and 13–98 ng {gÀ}1 on a lipid weight basis, respectively. Among the {POPs}, {DDTs} showed distinct regional difference in concentration levels and composition between the western and eastern offshore of Korea. One of the highest concentrations of {DDTs} so far recorded in the western offshore of Korea, that is Yellow Sea. This implies ongoing fresh input of technical {DDT} to this regional sea. {HCHs} were relatively high in the Yellow Sea as well, with an enhanced signal of c-{HCH} indicating recent input of lindane. In contrast, {CHLs} showed higher level in the eastern offshore of Korea, that is East Sea, but {PCBs} showed an even distribution in both regions. Squid could be a useful bio-indicator for monitoring offshore water contamination by {POPs}.},

	abstract = {Connectivity of populations through the transfer of individuals is one of the key processes for maintaining ecosystem stability and resilience of coastal ecosystems. During reproduction, dislodged seaweeds of the genus Sargassum form large pelagic surface rafts that can persist for several weeks, and potentially act as a dispersal vector. In surface rafts, seaweeds are rapidly exposed to increased light, elevated temperatures, and altered hydrodynamic conditions. Acclimation to surface conditions is necessary for survival during the rafting phase, but there is limited knowledge of seaweed physiology in rafts. To understand the mechanisms for acclimation, we created rafts of ﬂoating Sargassum spinuligerum for 2 weeks and compared these experimental fronds to those attached to the seaﬂoor. We measured nutrients, photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic pigments, and phlorotannins to investigate their role in the persistence of mature Sargassum at the ocean surface as indicated by photosynthetic rates and reproductive status. We also studied potential surface movement of the rafted seaweed over 3-weeks of particle tracking using an existing oceanographic model. Photosynthesis and reproductive status were similar between benthic and rafted seaweeds, indicating no change to overall metabolic processes during rafting. While phlorotannin concentrations and photosynthetic pigments were unchanged, photoprotective xanthophyll pigments were more abundant in rafted individuals, suggesting acclimation to surface light conditions. Our results suggest that, in the short term, S. spinuligerum employ chemical strategies to acclimate and maintain physiological processes in the rafting environment and potentially ﬁx more carbon, allowing these rafts to act as dispersal vectors among populations over tens of kilometers apart.},

Wood boring shipworms (Bivalvia: Teredinidae) were either already present in, or settled on, the wooden fraction of this debris, offering a unique opportunity to study shipworm diversity in rafted wood of a known origin and time of ocean entry. Lumber and other wood began appearing on Central Pacific (Hawaiian Islands) and Eastern Pacific beaches in 2013. Eighty pieces of wood Japanese Tsunami Marine Debris ({JTMD}) consisting of construction beams, trees, milled logs, and wood from vessels or maritime structures were analyzed. Six shipworm species resident in the coastal waters of Japan were found: Bankia bipennata (Turton, 1819), Bankia carinata (Gray, 1827), Teredothyra smithi (Bartsch, 1927), Psiloteredo sp., Lyrodus takanoshimensis (Roch, 1929), and Teredo navalis Linnaeus, 1758. Two pelagic species, Teredora princesae (Sivickis, 1928) and Uperotus clava (Gmelin, 1791), were acquired by {JTMD} wood in the transoceanic voyage. Several of these wood items were discovered soon after stranding and contained live shipworms. Up to five shipworm species were found in any one wooden object. The present work represents the first study of the diversity and abundance of shipworms transported across an ocean basin in a large woody debris field.},

Paint particle bioﬁlm communities appear to be distinct from natural (water and sediment), non-synthetic particle (cellulose) and common microplastic bioﬁlm communities. Notably, there appears to be 1 group of sulphate-reducing bacteria from the Desulfobacteraceae family, Desulfatitalea tepidiphilia, that dominate certain paint bioﬁlms. Of the 8 investigated paint-associated communities, four paints displayed this high Desulfobacteraceae presence. However, it is currently unclear from the chemical analysis performed of the paint surface chemistry ({ATR} {FT}-{IR} spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, {SEM}-{EDX}) what the drivers behind this might be. As such, this study provides important insights as the ﬁrst to analyse microplastic-paint bioﬁlm communities and paves the way for future research.},

This study is based on the extensive results of monitoring the styrene oligomers ({SOs}) present in sand and seawater samples along various coastlines of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Here, anthropogenic {SOs} is derived from {PS} during manufacture and use, and can provide clues about the origin of {SOs} by {PS} pollution. The monitoring results showed that, if the concentration of {SOs} in water is higher than those concentrations in beach sand, this area could be affected by {PS} plastic caused by an external factor. On the other hand, if the concentration of {SOs} is higher in the beach sand, the region can be mainly inﬂuenced by {PS} plastic derived from its own area. Unlike the case of an external factor, in this case (internal inﬂuence), it is possible to take policy measures of the area itself for the {PS} plastic problem. Thus, this study is motivated by the need of policy measures to establish a speciﬁc alternative to the problems of {PS} plastic pollution in ocean environments.},

The results indicate that the plastic, paper and wood debris occur in the greatest number followed by food waste and metal. The major contributing factor for the debris abundance in Marina beach is the local recreational activity which suggests that the land-based sources provide major inputs to plastic pollution at the beach.

Much of the plastic entering the ocean sinks; this is intuitively obvious for polymers such as polystyrene ({PS}), which have a greater density than seawater, but lower density polymers like polyethylene ({PE}) also occur in sediments. Biofouling can cause large plastic objects to sink, but this phenomenon has not been described for microplastics {\textless}5 mm. We incubated {PS} and {PE} microplastic particles in estuarine and coastal waters to determine how biofouling changes their sinking behavior. Sinking velocities of {PS} increased by 16\% in estuarine water (salinity 9.8) and 81\% in marine water (salinity 36) after 6 weeks of incubation. Thereafter sinking velocities decreased due to lower water temperatures and reduced light availability. Biofouling did not cause {PE} to sink during the 14 weeks of incubation in estuarine water, but {PE} started to sink after six weeks in coastal water when sufﬁciently colonized by blue mussels Mytilus edulis, and its velocity continued to increase until the end of the incubation period. Sinking velocities of these {PE} pellets were similar irrespective of salinity (10 vs. 36).

The simulated release of virtual particles in different parts of the inner estuary suggests a residence time shorter than 5 days before being exported through the estuary mouth (intermediate compartment) to the open ocean. Stranded litter supported this pathway, with beaches in the internal compartment presenting proportionally more items from domestic sources, while fragmented items with unknown sources were proportionally more abundant in the oceanic beaches. Regressive vector analysis reinforced the inner estuarine origin of the stranded litter in both estuarine and oceanic beaches. These results support the applicability of simple hydrodynamic models to address marine debris' transboundary issues in the landsea transition zone, thus supporting an ecosystem transboundary (and not territorial) management approach.},

The sinking velocity was not solely related to particle density, size and ﬂuid density but also to the particles shape leading to considerable deviation from calculated theoretical values. Thus, experimental studies are indispensable to get basic knowledge about the sinking behaviour and to gain representative datasets for model approaches estimating the distribution of microplastics in aquatic systems. The sinking behaviour may be altered considerably by weathering and biofouling demanding further studies with aged and fouled plastic particles. Furthermore, assumptions are made about the inﬂuence of sinking fouled microplastics on the marine carbon pump by transferring organic carbon to deeper water depths.},

Despite Greece having more than 16,000 km of coastline, studies on litter composition and sources on its beaches are scarce and fragmentary. Therefore, this study aimed to quantify beach-stranded litter by type of material (plastic, glass, paper, aluminum, other metals, building materials, rope) on 80 Greek beaches, and to explore the relationships between different litter materials and marineand land-based sources. Field work and data collection were accomplished with the participation of 10,938 and 15,748 volunteers in 2006 and 2007, respectively, and were integrated in the nationwide campaign of voluntary beach clean-ups: “Clean up the Med.” The participation of thousands of volunteers of different ages and social backgrounds in the data collection process not only led to the realization of a national level survey, but also played a signiﬁcant role in raising public awareness on marine environmental issues, and in promoting a sense of responsibility in protecting marine resources. Plastic was the most abundant litter material found on the surveyed beaches (43–51\%), followed by paper (13–18\%) and aluminum (7–12\%). Onshore and nearshore recreational activities, such as bathing and recreational boating, appeared to be the most dominant litter sources, as they affect the majority (56) of the surveyed beaches, suggesting that environmental education and awareness could reduce the beach-litter pollution problem. Navigation seemed to be the dominant source of marine-based litter, affecting more than half (46) of the surveyed beaches.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest size-selective removal of small plastic particles from the ocean surface, an observation that remains unexplained. We studied one of the hypotheses regarding this size-selective removal: the formation of a bioﬁlm on the microplastics (biofouling). We developed the ﬁrst theoretical model that is capable of simulating the eﬀect of biofouling on the fate of microplastic. The model is based on settling, bioﬁlm growth, and ocean depth proﬁles for light, water density, temperature, salinity, and viscosity. Using realistic parameters, the model simulates the vertical transport of small microplastic particles over time, and predicts that the particles either ﬂoat, sink to the ocean ﬂoor, or oscillate vertically, depending on the size and density of the particle. The predicted size-dependent vertical movement of microplastic particles results in a maximum concentration at intermediate depths. Consequently, relatively low abundances of small particles are predicted at the ocean surface, while at the same time these small particles may never reach the ocean ﬂoor. Our results hint at the fate of “lost” plastic in the ocean, and provide a start for predicting risks of exposure to microplastics for potentially vulnerable species living at these depths.},

Trash yield per kilometre of shoreline was higher in isolated areas and in areas with exposed shorelines. The majority of recovered litter items were composed of plastic.

	abstract = {Understanding the global mass inventory is one of the main challenges in present research on plastic marine debris. Especially the fragmentation and vertical transport processes of oceanic plastic are poorly understood. However, whereas fragmentation rates are unknown, information on plastic emissions, concentrations of plastics in the ocean surface layer ({OSL}) and fragmentation mechanisms is available. Here, we apply a systems engineering analytical approach and propose a tentative ‘whole ocean’ mass balance model that combines emission data, surface area-normalized plastic fragmentation rates, estimated concentrations in the {OSL}, and removal from the {OSL} by sinking. We simulate known plastic abundances in the {OSL} and calculate an average whole ocean apparent surface area-normalized plastic fragmentation rate constant, given representative radii for macroplastic and microplastic. Simulations show that 99.8\% of the plastic that had entered the ocean since 1950 had settled below the {OSL} by 2016, with an additional 9.4 million tons settling per year. In 2016, the model predicts that of the 0.309 million tons in the {OSL}, an estimated 83.7\% was macroplastic, 13.8\% microplastic, and 2.5\% was {\textless} 0.335 mm ‘nanoplastic’. A zero future emission simulation shows that almost all plastic in the {OSL} would be removed within three years, implying a fast response time of surface plastic abundance to changes in inputs. The model complements current spatially explicit models, points to future experiments that would inform critical model parameters, and allows for further validation when more experimental and ﬁeld data become available.},

	abstract = {Ocean litter has accumulated rapidly and is becoming a major environmental concern, yet quantitative and regular observations and exploration that track litter origins are limited. By implementing monthly sample collections over ﬁve years (2012–2016) at Dongsha Island, a remote island in the northern South China Sea ({SCS}), we assessed macro ocean litter dynamics, identiﬁed source countries of individual plastic bottles, and analyzed the origins of the litter by a backward-tracking model simulation considering both the effects of current velocity and windage. The results showed that large amounts of litter, which varied monthly and annually in weight and quantity, reached the island during the study years, and there were spatial differences in accumulation patterns between the north and south coasts. Styrofoam and plastic bottles were the two primary sources of macro ocean litter both annually and monthly, and most of the litter collected on the island originated from China and Vietnam, which were collectively responsible for approximately 47.5\%–63.7\% per month. The simulation indicated that current advection at the near-surface depths and low windage at the sea surface showed similar patterns, while medium to high windage exhibited comparable expression patterns in response to potential source regions and drifting time experiments. At either the surface with low windage or current advection at depths of 0.5 m and 1 m, macro ocean litter in the Western Philippine Sea, i.e. through the Luzon Strait between Taiwan and the Philippines, was an important contributor to the litter bulk from October to March, whereas the litter was predicted to mainly originate from the southwestern {SCS} from April to September. With an increasing windage effect, litter in the Taiwan Strait was predicted to be an additional major potential source. Surprisingly, a small proportion of the macro ocean litter was predicted to continuously travel in the northern {SCS} for a long duration ({\textgreater} 2 years) before drifting onto Dongsha Island. The estimated drifting time of macro ocean litter also showed monthly and directional variability. This study demonstrated that a tremendous quantity of macro ocean litter, which may cause great damage to the marine ecosystem, drifts in the ocean surface layer and is ﬁnally pushed onto beaches. Therefore, we proposed an action plan for effective ocean litter management development at regional and global spatial scales, which is vital for improving and restoring the health and sustainability of the oceanic environment.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the degradation potential of plastics in the marine environment, microorganisms that preferentially colonize and interact with plastic surfaces, as opposed to generalists potentially colonising everything, need to be identified. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that i.) plastic “specific” microorganisms are closely attached to the polymeric surface and ii.) that specificity of plastics biofilms are rather related to members of the rare biosphere. To answer these hypotheses, a three phased experiment to stepwise uncover closely attached microbes was conducted. In Phase 1, nine chemically distinct plastic films and glass were incubated in situ for 21 months in a seawater flow through system. In Phase 2, a high-pressure water jet treatment technique was used to remove the upper biofilm layers to further, in Phase 3, enrich a plastic “specific” community. To proof whether microbes colonizing different plastics are distinct from each other and from other inert hard substrates, the bacterial communities of these different substrates were analysed using 16S {rRNA} gene tag sequencing. Our findings indicate that tightly attached microorganisms account to the rare biosphere and suggest the presence of plastic “specific” microorganisms/assemblages which could benefit from the given plastic properties or at least grow under limited carbon resources.},

It describes ecosystems as consisting of individuals rather than species, and characterizes individuals by few key traits that are interrelated through trade-offs. The fundamental rationale is that the spatio-temporal distribution of organisms and their functional role in ecosystems depend on their traits rather than on their taxonomical afﬁliation. The approach respects that interactions are between individuals, not between species or populations, and in trait-based models ecosystem structure emerges as a result of interactions between individuals and with the environments, rather than being prescribed. It offers an alternative to classical species-centric approaches and has the potential to describe complex ecosystems in simple ways and to assess the effects of environmental change on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we describe the components of the trait-based approach and apply it to describe and model marine ecosystems. Our description is illustrated with multiple examples of life in the ocean from unicellular plankton to ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Floating anthropogenic litter provides habitat for a diverse community of marine organisms. A total of 387 taxa, including pro- and eukaryotic microorganisms, seaweeds and invertebrates, have been found rafting on floating litter in all major oceanic regions. Among the invertebrates, species of bryozoans, crustaceans, molluscs and cnidarians are most frequently reported as rafters on marine litter. Micro-organisms are also ubiquitous on marine litter although the composition of the microbial community seems to depend on specific substratum characteristics such as the polymer type of floating plastic items. Sessile suspension feeders are particularly well-adapted to the limited autochthonous food resources on artificial floating substrata and an extended planktonic larval development seems to facilitate colonization of floating litter at sea. Properties of floating litter, such as size and surface rugosity, are crucial for colonization by marine organisms and the subsequent succession of the rafting community. The rafters themselves affect substratum characteristics such as floating stability, buoyancy, and degradation. Under the influence of currents and winds marine litter can transport associated organisms over extensive distances. Because of the great persistence (especially of plastics) and the vast quantities of litter in the world’s oceans, rafting dispersal has become more prevalent in the marine environment, potentially facilitating the spread of invasive species.},

	abstract = {Malaysia has a long coastline and is well known for its beautiful beaches which play different roles, depending on the characteristics and location. With increasing population and rapid development, the beaches are experiencing threats from pollution. One of the most visible threats is due to solid waste disposal. A scientiﬁc quantitative dataset of marine debris in Malaysia is, however, very rare. Therefore, a study on marine debris was conducted on two beaches in Port Dickson, Malaysia, from January to March 2010. The objective of the study was to compare the density of waste on two selected beaches with different economic activities. Teluk Kemang and Pasir Panjang are recreational and ﬁshing beaches, respectively. Pasir Panjang received at least 2 units of debris for every 2 m2 (0.495 ± 0.108 items m−2), weighing 46.079 ± 12.507 g m−2. Debris found in Teluk Kemang was lower than that of Pasir Panjang with 1 unit of waste for every 2 m2 (0.262 ± 0.045 items m−2), weighing 2.067 ± 1.238 g m−2. Based on the number of items, plastics were the most abundant type of debris at 64\% in Teluk Kemang and 46\% in Pasir Panjang. In terms of weight, paper was higher (48\%) than plastic (43\%) in Teluk Kemang, while the highest percentage of debris found on Pasir Panjang beach was bulky waste (54\%). The number of items and weight of debris were higher in Pasir Panjang due to the abundance of huge and heavy abandoned nets from ﬁshing activities left on the beach. Daily clean-ups of Teluk Kemang, a popular recreational beach, contributed to signiﬁcantly lower amounts of debris found there. On the whole, types of waste found on both beaches were similar. However, the percentage and amount of each waste’s type varied between the two beaches. The results indicated that the density of waste is highly dependable on the economic activities of the relevant beaches.},

As knowledge on {MP}-attached communities is insufﬁcient for brackish ecosystems, we conducted exposure experiments in the coastal Baltic Sea, an in-ﬂowing river and a {WWTP} within the drainage basin. While reporting on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set-up previously, we focus here on the entire eukaryotic communities. Using high-throughput 18S {rRNA} gene sequencing, we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of {MP}, polyethylene and polystyrene, and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on a natural surface (wood). More than 500 different taxa across almost all kingdoms of the eukaryotic tree of life were identiﬁed on {MP}, dominated by Alveolata, Metazoa, and Chloroplastida. The eukaryotic community composition on {MP} was signiﬁcantly distinct from wood and the surrounding water, with overall lower diversity and the potentially harmful dinoﬂagellate Pﬁesteria being enriched on {MP}. Co-occurrence networks, which include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial interactions on {MP}. This ﬁrst report on total eukaryotic communities on {MP} in brackish environments highlights the complexity of {MP}-associated bioﬁlms, potentially leading to altered microbial activities and hence changes in ecosystem functions.},

Microplastics (plastic particles {\textless}5 mm) are especially susceptible to ingestion by marine organisms, as the size of these particles makes them available also to lower trophic levels. Because many marine invertebrates harbour potential pathogens in their guts, we investigated whether bacterial assemblages on polystyrene are selectively modiﬁed during their passage through the gut of the lugworm Arenicola marina and are subsequently able to develop pathogenic bioﬁlms. We also examined whether polystyrene acts as a vector for gut bioﬁlm assemblages after subsequent incubation of the egested particles in seawater. Our results showed that after passage through the digestive tract of A. marina, the bacterial assemblages on polystyrene particles and reference glass beads became more similar, harbouring common sediment bacteria. By contrast, only in the presence of polystyrene the potential symbiont Amphritea atlantica was enriched in the investigated bioﬁlms, faeces, and water. Thus, especially in areas of high polystyrene contamination, this polymer may impact the bacterial composition of different habitats, with as yet unknown consequences for the respective ecosystems.},

In October 2016, the species proved to be common on navigational buoys in Belgian coastal waters and after a dedicated search we discovered the species on many groynes all along the Belgian coast and in the harbour of Zeebrugge. We identified the species both morphologically and genetically. We found two generations indicating that B. glandula had settled in 2015 (possibly the first year of its presence) and also in 2016. We provide identification characters to distinguish B. glandula from other, similar looking, Western European intertidal barnacles. The distribution of B. glandula was originally limited to the Pacific coast of North America. In the past half century B. glandula successfully invaded subsequently the coasts of Argentina, Japan and South Africa. Given its invasion history elsewhere, we forecast that B. glandula is on the brink of invading other European shores.},

The types of munitions and munitions debris in the images were identiﬁed by an ordnance and explosives safety specialist. To the extent feasible, non-munitions related debris were also identiﬁed. Biologists then examined the images and identiﬁed the types and numbers of animals: (1) on or near (o 1 m) the M47A2 bombs; (2) on other manmade debris, including other munitions; and (3) on the natural substrate that was predominantly sediment with little, if any, topographic relief. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze these data to identify differences between the biota inhabiting the three substrates. The analysis indicated that the types and numbers of animals associated with the M47A2 bombs were not signiﬁcantly different from those observed on other types of munitions and other manmade debris; however they were signiﬁcantly different from the animals found only on the natural sediment. Based on these results, it appears that the mustard-ﬁlled bombs are providing hard substrate similar to other disposed objects, attracting “hard substrate species” that would not have otherwise colonized the area. Even though it is apparent that many of the mustard-ﬁlled bombs have breached and their contents exposed, the analysis did not ﬁnd any evidence of animals avoiding the mustard-ﬁlled bombs.},

Anthropogenic debris was observed in 469 tows at depths of 55–1280 m. Plastic and metallic debris occurred in the greatest number of hauls followed by fabric and glass. Mean density was 67.1 items {kmÀ}2 throughout the study area but was signiﬁcantly higher south of 36°000N latitude. Mean density signiﬁcantly increased with depth, ranging from 30 items {kmÀ}2 in shallow (55–183 m) water to 128 items {kmÀ}2 in the deepest depth stratum (550–1280 m). Debris densities observed along the {US} West Coast were comparable to those seen elsewhere and provide a valuable backdrop for future comparisons.},

In the Mediterranean Sea, the same pathways have been identified as the main ones, with the Suez Canal being the most important. The role of marine litter as a vector of introduction or secondary spread of alien species in the Mediterranean has not been considered and studied so far. Primary introductions of alien species in the Mediterranean Sea by rafting on floating litter through the Suez Canal or the Gibraltar strait could have occurred. Furthermore, the huge amounts of floating plastic in the Mediterranean offer increased opportunities for many alien species to further spread in the Basin. Thirteen established aliens in the Mediterranean are known to be able to colonize floating litter. Furthermore, as inferred from their life cycle and traits, more than 80\% of the known alien species in the Mediterranean could potentially use litter for further expanding their range (after their initial introduction).},

The analysis results revealed the occurrence of a combination of offshore currents and convergence of alongshore currents in the surf zone in storm events around a submerged breakwater off the northern part of the beach, where 48\% of the backwashed ﬂoats were last found. We conclude that the majority of the ﬂoats on the beach were transported alongshore and tended to concentrate in the convergence zone, from where they were backwashed offshore by the nearshore currents generated in the events.},

The characteristics are fully determined by the residence time of the items (sr = 209 days) and can be described as functions of the ratio of sr to the period of input variability. The decay is reproduced well by the analytical solution of the equation with a constant diffusion coefﬁcient (D), whose order was estimated by sr and the backshore width.

Both {BCEs} depend strongly on the average residence time of marine plastics on the beach (sr) and the period of temporal variability of the input ﬂux of marine plastics (T). Cleanups on the beach where sr is longer than T are more effective than those where sr is shorter than T. In addition, both {BCEs} are the highest near the time when the remnants of plastics reach the local maximum (peak time). Therefore, it is crucial to understand the following three factors for effective cleanups: the average residence time, the plastic input period and the peak time.},

This period encompasses the anomalous wind events in 1994 and 1997–1998 that led to anomalous oceanic state including anomalous sea surface heights and sea surface temperatures, especially in the equatorial regions. Since the in situ database in the Indian Ocean is rather sparse, the hindcast provides an alternative means of examining the state of the ocean, including its interior, during these anomalous years, as well as normal years during this period. By comparison with observations available during this period, it is shown that the model possesses reasonable skill to be useful in the description of various events in the North Indian Ocean. In this paper, we examine the circulation and its variability over the 12 years of the hindcast. We discuss equatorial events, as well as events in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, including the Somali Current system. The heat and mass ﬂuxes are examined. Finally, the hindcast is repeated with {QuikSCAT} wind stress ﬁelds available from July 1999 onwards. Comparison of the 2000–2004 hindcasts forced by {ECMWF} winds and {QS} wind stresses shows that in the former, the currents and ﬂuxes are underestimated by 20–30\%, but the circulation patterns are roughly similar.},

Diﬀerent types of marine litter {\textgreater} 2.5 cm were classiﬁed according to the protocol of the {ICES} International Bottom Trawl Survey. The results showed considerable geographical variation: In the North Sea, a mean litter abundance of 16.8 {LI}/km2 was found, whereas the litter abundance in the Baltic Sea was signiﬁcantly lower (5.07 {LI}/km2). In general, plastic represented 80\% of the litter items. During the study, some methodical aspects with possible impact on the results were identiﬁed that need to be addressed in future sampling campaigns.},

	abstract = {Biofouling formation on marine constructions may cause significant problem such as bridge and vessel damages. Bacterial biofilms are the initiating cause of biofouling. Unfortunately, information of identified biofilm-forming bacteria associated with biofouling process in Indonesian seawaters was still limited. The purpose of this study was to identify biofilm-forming bacteria from biofouling of surface of steel panels exposed in Seawaters of Jakarta Bay and Madura Strait. Steel panels coated either with antifouling or anticorrosion paints were put into sea waters of Jakarta Bay and Madura Strait. Isolation of bacteria was conducted from steel panels fully covered by fouling organisms and on surface without fouling. Confirmation of biofilm-forming activities was performed based on crystal violets-stained bacterial materials on polystyrene well plates. As results, accumulation of macroorganisms and microorganisms was recognized visually on anticorrosion-coated panel that had been put in all observed sea waters for one month. However, biofouling appearances were not recognized on the antifouling-coated panel. Bacterial colonies isolated from Jakarta Bay (108 isolates) and Madura Strait (30 isolates) were screened for biofilm formation on polystyrene well plates. Five isolates representing the most active strain to biofouling activity were then identified based on 16S {rRNA} gene sequences. As results, isolates of Jakarta Bay C021.{MB}.1.8, C221.{MB}.{II}.11, and C221.{MB}.{II}.12 was closely related to Vibrio alginolyticus (99 \% similarity). Another two isolates of Madura Strait J111.{SM} and J111.1.10-6.S had similarity to Vibrio natriegens (99 \% to 100 \%). All these biofilm-forming bacteria were isolated from biofouling of panels coated with anticorrosion paints. In addition, we confirmed that V. alginolyticus C021.{MB}.1.8 formed biofilm only if growth medium is seawater from Jakarta Bay. Our study and the bacterial collections will be useful for evaluating and developing new antifouling paints that will be applied in sea waters of these two sites.},

However, knowledge of the plastic-associated microbial community (the plastisphere) in the intertidal zone is scanty. We used high-throughput sequencing to proﬁle the bacterial communities attached to microplastic samples from intertidal locations around the Yangtze estuary in China. The structure and composition of plastisphere communities varied signiﬁcantly among the locations. We found the taxonomic composition on microplastic samples was related to their sedimentary and aquatic origins. Correlation network analysis was used to identify keystone bacterial genera (e.g. Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and Rhizobiales), which represented important microbial associations within the plastisphere community. Other species (i.e. potential pathogens) were considered as hitchhikers in the plastic attached microbial communities. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested adaptations of these bacterial assemblages to the plastic surface-colonization lifestyle. These adaptations included reduced “cell motility” and greater “xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism.” The ﬁndings illustrate the diverse microbial assemblages that occur on microplastic and increase our understanding of plastisphere ecology.},

The abundance of plastics by weight in Dadar was signiﬁcantly higher than that in Aksa. The size fractionation of plastics proved that small particles (1–20 mm) are predominant with 41.85\% microplastics (1–5 mm) which emphasizes the high risk to marine organisms due to possible ingestion. The highest quantity of microplastics was seen in Juhu beach (55.33\%) followed by Versova, Aksa and Dadar. The major contributing factors for the abundance are beach usage for different activities such as recreational, religious and ﬁshing which suggest that the land-based sources provide major inputs to plastic pollution in these beaches.},

Even in the remote Svalbard Archipelago, pollution impacts the beach system and can pose environmental threats. The significant increase in human activity observed in Svalbard over the last 20–30 years has resulted in a visible change in the amount of coastal pollution. A 5 km long transect of modern beach developed along Calypsostranda (Recherchefjorden, Bellsund) was surveyed in the summer of 2015 in order to characterize the beach pollution. During the survey 296 pieces of trash were found on beach surface. 82\% of found trash was plastic, followed by glass (8\%), and metal (5\%). The comparison with previous pollution survey showed the significant increase of plastic waste in local beach environment. Similar problem has been recently recorded in other parts of Svalbard suggesting an urgent need for coastal pollution monitoring.},

A large number of {EPS} particles (131 ± 131 particles/individual, 0.2–3.8 mm in length) were found in the digestive tracts of burrowing polychaetes living on {EPS} debris. To conﬁrm the formation of microplastics by polychaetes and identify the quantity and morphology of produced microplastics, polychaetes were exposed to {EPS} blocks in ﬁltered seawater under laboratory conditions. Polychaetes burrowed into the blocks and created numerous {EPS} microplastic particles, indicating that a single polychaete can produce hundreds of thousands of microplastic particles per year.

We recorded at least one item of debris in 50 and 42\% of nests at the egg and nestling stages, respectively. More debris was found in nests located in territories with higher number of anthropogenic material in the surrounding environment. We found a relationship between the age of females, the number of debris in the area surrounding a nest, and the number of debris in the nest. We found no significant effect of the total number of debris in nests on clutch size, number of fledglings, or breeding success. Studies on the influence of the age and sex of individuals in understanding this behaviour and its drivers in bird populations should be continued.},

	abstract = {When invasive species become integrated within a food web, they may have numerous direct and indirect impacts on the native community by creating novel trophic links, and modifying or disrupting existing ones. Here we discuss these impacts by drawing on examples from freshwater ecosystems, and argue that future research should quantify changes in such trophic interactions (i.e. the links in a food web), rather than simply focusing on traditional measures of diversity or abundance (i.e. the nodes in a food web). We conceptualise the impacts of invaders on trophic links as either direct consumption, indirect trophic effects (e.g. cascading interactions, competition) or indirect nontrophic effects (e.g. behaviour mediated). We then discuss how invader impacts on trophic links are context-dependent, varying with invader traits (e.g. feeding rates), abiotic variables (e.g. temperature, {pH}) and the traits of the receiving community (e.g. predators or competitors). Co-occurring invasive species and other environmental stressors, such as climate change, will also influence invader impacts on trophic links. Finally, we discuss the available methods to identify new food web interactions following invasion and to quantify how invasive species disrupt existing feeding links. Methods include direct observations in the field, laboratory trials (e.g. to quantify functional responses) and controlled mesocosm experiments to elucidate impacts on food webs. Field studies which use tracer techniques, such as stable isotope analyses, allow diet characterisation of both invaders and interacting native species in the wild. We conclude that invasive species often drastically alter food webs by creating and disrupting trophic links, and future research should be directed particularly towards disentangling the effects of invaders from other environmental stressors.},

Given this fact, there is now a palpable feeling for the need to analyse the scientometric aspects of publications in this topic aiming to comprehend the impact of microplastic-microbiology studies within the scientific literature as a whole. Scientometrics is a research field focused on understanding of the metrics of science. From a researcher’s perspective, it is a powerful tool to increase, for example, the ability to find the best journal for a specific paper, and consequently have a better chance to have this paper cited, which is crucial considering the competitiveness of the modern scientific landscape. However, scientists working in specific research fields, from natural sciences to engineering; mathematics to medicine, are typically unaware of the knowledge that can be gleaned from bibliometrics or scientometrics when outlining their publications strategies. This paper aims to improve this knowledge base for researchers working in microplastic and microbiological research. A total of 47 publications under analysis span from 2011 to 2018, and have been published in 23 journals, most of them interdisciplinary journals that are available for a widespread audience from both complementary and diverse subject areas. Despite a short citation window, publications received {\textgreater} 390 citations with a clear exponential pattern, showing a promising future for microplastic-microbiological research. Whether insofar, a researcher has been focused on either solely microplastics or microbiology, as these fields continue to collide as microplastic-microbiology interaction research continues to increase, this paper might illuminate the next steps for researchers preparing future publications.},

	abstract = {Marine debris, especially plastic debris, is a global problem that requires intense monitoring and management since it affects humans, marine organisms and the environment. This study aimed to examine and compare the abundance and composition of marine macro debris found on three beaches of South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. All three sites were situated in the Makassar Strait, and similarly exposed to the Indonesian Through-Flow; however each site had a different land-use designation: residential area (Labuange), recreational area (Lumpue), and restricted/private area (Bojo). From March to May 2018, marine macro debris was collected monthly on each beach, along a 2x25 m2 transect (with three replicates/site). The samples were cleaned, sorted, counted, weighed, and analysed statistically. Plastic and rubber dominated marine macro debris in the study area (mean: 8285\%). The abundance of marine debris from Lumpue and Bojo beaches decreased drastically. However marine debris from Labuange beach remained greater in each sampling period (4.677.62 items per m2), probably due to additional litter from the village. Beach morphology and wave direction pattern were also responsible for the high volume of marine debris washed up, especially on Labuange beach. Plastic and rubber, cloth/fabric, and processed lumber debris were the heaviest debris, with different orders in each site. Management efforts, including frequent local waste and marine debris collection, are required to minimize the impacts of marine debris on the environment.},

The model was used to interpret the distributions of small plastic fragments and the possible transport processes in coastal waters. Of note, the size and quantity of mesoplastics (approximately {\textgreater}5 mm) gradually increased close to the coast irrespective of the existence of river mouths, which probably act as a major source of anthropogenic marine debris. Additionally, microplastics were more dominant as we moved further offshore. The numerical model reproduced the near-shore trapping of mesoplastics, suggesting that mesoplastics are selectively conveyed onshore by a combination of Stokes drift and terminal velocity, dependent on fragment sizes. It is suggested that mesoplastics washed ashore on beaches degrade into microplastics, and that the microplastics, which are free from near-shore trapping, are thereafter spread offshore in coastal waters.

However, metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, copper and cadmium are accumulating to critical concentration in the environment and triggering co-selection of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The co-selection of metal driven antibiotic resistance in bacteria is achieved through co-resistance or cross resistance. Metal driven antibiotic resistant determinants evolved in bacteria and present on same mobile genetic elements are horizontally transferred to distantly related bacterial human pathogens. Additionally, in marine environment persistent pollutants like microplastics is recognized as a vector for the proliferation of metal/antibiotics and human pathogens. Recently published research conﬁrmed that horizontal gene transfer between phylogenetically distinct microbes present on microplastics is much faster than free living microbes. Therefore, microplastics act as an emerging hotspot for metal driven co-selection of multidrug resistant human pathogens and pose serious threat to humans which do recreational activities in marine environment and ingest marine derived foods. Therefore, marine environment co-polluted with metal, antibiotics, human pathogens and microplastics pose an emerging health threat globally.},

Therefore, plastic abundance was investigated on a small island of the Maldives. Plastic debris (N 1 mm) was sampled once in natural long-term accumulation zones at the north shore and at the high tide drift line of the south shore on seven consecutive days to quantify daily plastic accumulation. Reliable identiﬁcation of plastic debris was ensured by {FTIR} spectroscopy. Despite the remoteness of the island a considerable amount of plastic debris was present. At both sites a high variability in plastic abundance on a spatial and temporal scale was observed, which may be best explained by environmental factors. In addition, our results show that snapshot sampling may deliver biased results and indicate that future monitoring programs should consider spatial and temporal variation of plastic deposition.},

We developed natural multi-species bioﬁlms of different ages on both high (glass) and low (polystyrene) wettability surfaces at mid-intertidal height (native habitat of B. amphitrite). Attachment choice of both young (0-d-old) and old (6-d-old) larvae to bioﬁlms was determined using still water choice bioassay. Irrespective of larval age, cyprid preferred to attach to unﬁlmed glass than to un-ﬁlmed polystyrene. In contrast to aged larvae, young larvae preferred old (6-d-old) bioﬁlms on polystyrene to young (3-d-old) bioﬁlms on glass. In this study, we were also able to examine the interaction between surface wettability, bioﬁlms and larval attachment, by characterizing bacterial community composition in bioﬁlms. Bacterial community composition showed signiﬁcant differences between bioﬁlms of different ages. Old bioﬁlms positively inﬂuenced larval attachment, irrespective of the type of substrata, thereby supporting the hypothesis that surface wettability does not alter the positive effect of natural bioﬁlms on larval attachment.},

With the task of aggregating the accepted species names for all marine species approaching completion, our focus has shifted to improving the consistency and quality of data held while keeping pace with the addition of {\textgreater} 2000 new marine species described annually. This paper defines priorities and longer-term aims that promote standardisation within and interoperability among biodiversity databases, provides editors with further information on how to input nomenclatural data in a standardised way and clarifies for users of {WoRMS} how and why names are represented as they are.

In nationwide beach litter surveys, we used a citizen science approach with schoolchildren and their teachers. Litter densities were substantially higher in Chile than in Germany. The different geographic zones surveyed in both countries showed strong grouping tendencies according to their main economic activities (tourism, shipping, fisheries/aquaculture), major litter sources, and {AMD} composition, in terms of dominance and diversity of {AMD} types. The results suggest that beach litter composition can be used as a simple proxy to identify {AMD} sources, and also that law enforcement and education can help mitigate the problem; however, for efficient solutions, production and consumption of plastics must be reduced.},

	abstract = {Accumulations of beach-cast seaweeds and other debris, collectively known as wrack, are a common and ecologically important occurrence along coastal regions worldwide. As the rate of seaweed introductions continues to increase, so too does their beach-cast collection for aesthetic or commercial purposes. The ecological eﬀects of these harvests are poorly characterized in the literature, especially for nutrient-rich regions such as the Northeast Paciﬁc. Within the southern extremity of Baynes Sound, British Columbia, beach wrack contains an introduced species of red alga called Mazzaella japonica, which became the target of a commercial beach-cast harvest in 2007. The objectives of this research were threefold: 1) to quantify the contribution of M. japonica to wrack inputs within the harvest region; 2) to explore how wrack characteristics inﬂuence macrofauna communities; and 3) to determine if the commercial removal of beach-cast seaweeds has a detectable eﬀect on wrack characteristics and macrofauna communities. To answer these questions we monitored a series of permanent transects at six sites across the harvest region from November 2014 until March 2015. We recorded as much as 853 kg ( ± 173 {SD}) of wrack per meter of shoreline, approximately 90\% of which was M. japonica. Despite the removal of 675 tonnes of beach-cast seaweeds, we found that the trends in wrack biomass were similar between both harvested and unharvested locations. Macrofauna communities diﬀered between study sites, as well as with the age class, and depth of the wrack from which they were sampled. These ﬁndings contribute to the limited literature on beach-cast seaweed harvesting and provide an important record of M. japonica wrack inputs for future research or monitoring of this non-indigenous seaweed.},

The presence of a bioﬁlm signiﬁcantly increased the amount of shredding, but plastic type (conventional, degradable and biodegradable) had no eﬀect. Subsequent ﬁeld observations conﬁrmed similar shredding occurred on the strandline.

Coastal and riverine input have been recognized as sources of plastic debris, whereas oceanic gyres and sediments are understood to be sinks. However, we have a limited understanding of the fate of plastic debris in the nearshore environment. To investigate the movement and distribution of plastic debris in the nearshore environment, we collected samples at three distinct locations: below the high tide line, the turbulent zone created by the combination of breaking wave and backﬂush (deﬁned as the boundary), and the outer nearshore. We estimated the abundance and physical characteristics (e.g. density, hardness, etc.) of macroplastic and microplastics. Four times and 15 times more macroplastics and microplastics are observed, respectively, at the boundary than in the outer nearshore waters, which suggests an accumulation driven by the physical properties of the plastic particles such as density, buoyancy and surface area. We further report that highly energetic conditions characteristic of the boundary area promote the long-term suspension and/or degradation of low density, highly buoyant or large surface area plastic debris, leading to their preferential accumulation at the boundary. Contrastingly, denser and low surface area plastic pieces were transported to the outer nearshore. These results emphasize the role of selective plastic movement at the nearshore driven by physical properties, but also by the combined effects of several hydrodynamics forces like wave action, wind or tide in the resuspension, as well as degradation and transport of plastic debris out of the nearshore environment.},

Identifying the origins of {FMD} (land- or sea-based) is important to take the necessary steps to diminish their abundance. Using ship surveys we examined the abundance, composition and distribution of {FMD} during the years 2002–2005 in the fjords, gulfs and channels of southern Chile. Abundances of {FMD} were relatively high compared with other studies, ranging from 1 to 250 items {kmÀ}2. The majority (\$80\%) of {FMD} was composed of styrofoam (expanded polystyrene), plastic bags and plastic fragments. Styrofoam, which is intensively used as ﬂoatation device by mussel farms, was very abundant in the northern region but rarely occurred in the southern region of the study area. Food sacks from salmon farms were also most common in the northern region, where \$85\% of the total Chilean mussel and salmon harvest is produced. Plastic bags, which could be from land- or sea-based sources, were found throughout the entire study area. Our results indicate that sea-based activities (mussel farming and salmon aquaculture) are responsible for most {FMD} in the study area. In order to reduce {FMDs} in the environment, in addition to stronger legislation and identiﬁcation of potential sources, we suggest environmental education programs and we encourage public participation (e.g. in beach surveys and clean-ups).},

	abstract = {Floating objects are suggested to be the principal vector for the transport and dispersal of marine invertebrates with direct development as well as catalysts for carbon and nutrient recycling in accumulation areas. The ﬁrst step in identifying the ecological relevance of ﬂoating objects in a speciﬁc area is to identify their spatio-temporal distribution. We evaluated the composition, abundance, distribution, and temporal variability of ﬂoating objects along the continental coast of central–southern Chile (33–421S) and the Patagonian fjords (42–501S) using ship surveys conducted in austral winter (July/August) and spring (November) of the years 2002–2005 and 2008. Potential sources of ﬂoating items were identiﬁed with the aid of publicly available databases and scientiﬁc reports. We found three main types of ﬂoating objects, namely ﬂoating marine debris (mainly plastic objects and Styrofoam), wood (trunks and branches), and ﬂoating kelps (Macrocystis pyrifera and Durvillaea antarctica). Floating marine debris were abundant along most of the examined transects, with markedly lower abundances toward the southern fjord areas. Floating marine debris abundances generally corresponded to the distribution of human activities, and were highest in the Interior Sea of Chiloe´ , where aquaculture activities are intense. Floating wood appeared sporadically in the study area, often close to the main rivers. In accordance with seasonal river run-off, wood was more abundant along the continental coast in winter (rainy season) and in the Patagonian fjords during the spring surveys (snow melt). Densities of the two ﬂoating kelp species were similar along the continental coast, without a clear seasonal pattern. M. pyrifera densities increased towards the south, peaking in the Patagonian fjords, where it was dominant over D. antarctica. Densities of M. pyrifera in the Patagonian fjords were highest in spring. Correlation analyses between the abundances of ﬂoating objects and the distance to the nearest sources were generally non-signiﬁcant, suggesting that post-supply processes affect the distribution of the ﬂoating objects in the study region. The identiﬁcation of several major retention zones supports this idea. Accumulation areas of ﬂoating objects appear to be more common in the fjord zones. In general, the results underscore the abundance of ﬂoating objects throughout the study region and the fact that ﬂoating marine debris sources are mostly local, whereas ﬂoating algae may be dispersed over greater distances. Future studies should focus on the ecological role of ﬂoating objects in biota dispersal and nutrient cycling.},

The citizen science project "National Sampling of Small Plastic Debris” was supported by schoolchildren from all over Chile who documented the distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches. Thirtynine schools and nearly 1000 students from continental Chile and Easter Island participated in the activity. To validate the data obtained by the students, all samples were recounted in the laboratory. The results of the present study showed that the students were able to follow the instructions and generate reliable data. The average abundance obtained was 27 small plastic pieces per m2 for the continental coast of Chile, but the samples from Easter Island had extraordinarily higher abundances ({\textgreater}800 items per m2). The abundance of small plastic debris on the continental coast could be associated with coastal urban centers and their economic activities. The high abundance found on Easter Island can be explained mainly by the transport of plastic debris via the surface currents in the South Paciﬁc Subtropical Gyre, resulting in the accumulation of small plastic debris on the beaches of the island. This ﬁrst report of the widespread distribution and abundance of small plastic debris on Chilean beaches underscores the need to extend plastic debris research to ecological aspects of the problem and to improve waste management.},

Currently operating transport mechanisms for marine macroalgae are either associations with intentional introductions (translocations for aquaculture, aquarium or live seafood trade) or accidental introductions (mainly as hull-fouling). A number of potential management options exist, including the development of international instruments and regional agreements. The development of treatment options for hull fouling, the most significant and poorly managed transport mechanism for macroalgae, is of urgent need. Our current ability to identify which species are likely to invade next is limited. However, an examination of the synergies between species’ functional traits, transport constraints, and recipient community attributes will likely provide possible options in the future.},

	abstract = {Marine debris accumulation was analyzed from three exposed beaches of the Canary Islands (Lambra, Famara and Las Canteras). Large microplastics (1–5 mm), mesoplastics (5–25 mm) and tar pollution were assessed twice a month for a year. There was great spatial and temporal variability in the Canary Island coastal pollution. Seasonal patterns diﬀered at each location, marine debris concentration depended mainly of local-scale wind and wave conditions. The most polluted beach was Lambra, a remote beach infrequently visited. The types of debris found were mainly preproduction resin pellets, plastic fragments and tar, evidencing that pollution was not of local origin, but it cames from the open sea. The levels of pollution were similar to those of highly industrialized and contaminated regions. This study corroborates that the Canary Islands are an area of accumulation of microplastics and tar rafted from the North Atlantic Ocean by the southward ﬂowing Canary Current.},

	abstract = {The diverse and pantropical genus Ctenitis, in the Dryopteridaceae, has been largely ignored in phylogenetic studies until now. In this study, we ﬁll in this gap by reconstructing the ﬁrst comprehensive phylogeny of the genus including 53 species currently recognized in the genus Ctenitis, among which seven species formerly were assigned to the genus Pseudotectaria and one to Heterogonium. Special emphasis was given to the sampling of species occurring in the African-Indian Ocean region. The presented results include reconstruction of a biogeographic scenario based on estimated divergence times and ancestral area reconstruction. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the inclusion, within Ctenitis, of the Indian Ocean species formerly placed in Pseudotectaria and Heterogonium. The crown group divergence was estimated to date back to the Oligocene or Early Miocene. The biogeographical scenario indicates an initial divergence of the Asian-Paciﬁc ranges and the neotropical ranges, and a subsequent colonization of the {AfroMadagascan} region by a lineage with neotropical ancestors. The Afro-Madagascan lineage splits into a lineage endemic to the Mascarene islands and a lineage occurring in Madagascar, the Comoros and Africa. The range expansion towards Africa and Madagascar was estimated to date back to the late Miocene, whereas the estimated ages for the onset of the diversiﬁcation of the Mascarene diversity is consistent with the ages of these young, volcanic islands. The absence of any extant species of Ctenitis with a multi-continental distribution range and the rarity of inter-island dispersal and speciation in the Indian Ocean region suggest a limited contribution of long distance dispersal to the biogeographical history of this fern genus, versus a high contribution of local speciation.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is a process that heavily alters marine and terrestrial environments, though terrestrial urban ecosystems have been studied far more intensively. Terrestrial studies suggest that urbanization can facilitate mesopredators by enhancing food and shelter resources and reducing predation pressure from apex consumers. This in turn has considerable consequences for ecological communities. We evaluated spatial distribution patterns and habitat-use of the marine mesopredator, giant Pacific octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini), relative to terrestrial urbanization intensity in Puget Sound, Washington, {USA}. Using field surveys and citizen-contributed data for E. dofleini, we examined whether: (1) Distribution was related to urbanization, (2) Abundance was related to the extent of benthic anthropogenic debris, and (3) Diet differed as a function of urbanization and den cover. Our results suggest that urbanization impacts may differ with depth. Mixed-effects logistic regression model estimates for the probability of occurrence increased with urbanization in deep-water ({\textgreater} 24 m), and decreased with urbanization in shallow water ({\textless} 18 m). Accompanying field surveys indicated that E. dofleini abundance was correlated with the number of benthic anthropogenic debris items, and that E. dofleini diets were not affected by urbanization intensity or den cover. Though E. dofleini may be synanthropic within certain urban environments, the mechanisms driving this pattern likely differ from those affecting common urban mesopredators on land, with den provisioning from man-made structures being more important than altered food resources.},

The Rake-method investigates sandy sediments to a depth of up to 50 mm. In average, we found 2.6 items / m2 in Germany (65\% micro and meso-litter) and 0.6 items / m2 in Lithuania (66\% micro and meso-litter). Using the Frame-method, covering the upper 30 mm, we received 1.8 items / m2 in Germany (64\% micro and meso-litter) and 5.3 items / m2 in Lithuania (86\% micro and meso-litter). Mostly found were cigarette butts, artificial polymers and in Lithuania paraffin. To test the reliability of both methods, recovery experiments were carried out. Depending on color and structure between 31 and 100\% of all items were recovered by the Frame-method and 31–77\% by the Rake-method. Using the Matrix Scoring Technique, tourism was identified as major pollution source. Both methods turned out to be suitable for sandy beaches, even if they are regular cleaned, and to assess pollution hot-spots. Both methods do not require elaborated equipment or a laboratory, are low in costs and can be carried out by volunteers. In comparison, the Rake method turned out to be more robust and cost-effective.},

Plastic waste is presumably not used preferentially for nest-building, but in the context of available nesting material in the waters surrounding the breeding colony. Therefore the share of garbage parts in nests of certain species of birds is an indicator of the amount of waste in the natural environment in the vicinity of their breeding site.},

Concerns over potential negative impacts on the economy, wildlife, and human health provide strong incentives for improving the sustainable use of plastics. Despite the many voices raised on the issue, we lack a consensus on how to deﬁne and categorize plastic debris. This is evident for microplastics, where inconsistent size classes are used and where the materials to be included are under debate. While this is inherent in an emerging research ﬁeld, an ambiguous terminology results in confusion and miscommunication that may compromise progress in research and mitigation measures. Therefore, we need to be explicit on what exactly we consider plastic debris. Thus, we critically discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a uniﬁed terminology, propose a deﬁnition and categorization framework, and highlight areas of uncertainty. Going beyond size classes, our framework includes physicochemical properties (polymer composition, solid state, solubility) as deﬁning criteria and size, shape, color, and origin as classiﬁers for categorization. Acknowledging the rapid evolution of our knowledge on plastic pollution, our framework will promote consensus building within the scientiﬁc and regulatory community based on a solid scientiﬁc foundation.},

	abstract = {Synthetic microplastics (≤ 5-mm fragments) are globally distributed contaminants within coastal sediments that may transport organic pollutants and additives into food webs. Although micro-Fourier-transform infrared (micro-{FT}-{IR}) spectroscopy represents an ideal method for detecting microplastics in sediments, this technique lacks a standardized operating protocol. Herein, an optimized method for the micro-{FT}-{IR} analysis of microplastics in vacuum-ﬁltered sediment retentates was developed. Reﬂectance micro-{FT}-{IR} analyses of polyethylene ({PE}) were compared with attenuated total reﬂectance {FT}-{IR} ({ATR}-{FT}-{IR}) measurements. Molecular mapping as a precursor to the imaging of microplastics was explored in the presence and absence of 150-μm {PE} fragments, added to sediment at concentrations of 10, 100, 500 and 1000 ppm. Subsequently, polymer spectra were assessed across plastic-spiked sediments from ﬁfteen offshore sites. While all spectra obtained of evenly shaped plastics were typical to {PE}, reﬂectance micro-{FT}-{IR} measurements of irregularly shaped materials must account for refractive error. Additionally, we provide the ﬁrst evidence that mapping successfully detects microplastics without their visual selection for characterization, despite this technique relying on spectra from small and spatially separated locations. Flotation of microplastics from sediments only enabled a fragment recovery rate of 61 (±31 S.D.) \%. However, mapping 3-mm2 areas (within 47-mm ﬁlters) detected {PE} at spiking concentrations of 100 ppm and above, displaying 69 (± 12 S.D.) \% of the fragments in these locations. Additionally, mapping detected a potential {PE} fragment in a non-spiked retentate. These data have important implications for research into the imaging of microplastics. Speciﬁcally, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the present protocol may be improved by visualizing the entire ﬁlter with high-throughput detection techniques (e.g., focal plane array-based imaging). Additionally, since micro-{FTIR} analyses depend on methods of sample collection, our results emphasize the urgency of developing efﬁcient and reproducible techniques to separate microplastics from sediments.},

	abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models ({LMMs}) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst {LMMs} offer a ﬂexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the ﬁtting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of {LMMs} to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying {LMMs} to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {Background: Synthetic microplastics (≤5-mm fragments) are emerging environmental contaminants that have been found to accumulate within coastal marine sediments worldwide. The ecological impacts and fate of microplastic debris are only beginning to be revealed, with previous research into these topics having primarily focused on higher organisms and/or pelagic environments. Despite recent research into plastic-associated microorganisms in seawater, the microbial colonization of microplastics in benthic habitats has not been studied. Therefore, we employed a 14-day microcosm experiment to investigate bacterial colonization of low-density polyethylene ({LDPE}) microplastics within three types of coastal marine sediment from Spurn Point, Humber Estuary, U.K.
Results: Bacterial attachment onto {LDPE} within sediments was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridisation ({CARD}-{FISH}). Log-fold increases in the abundance of 16S {rRNA} genes from {LDPE}-associated bacteria occurred within 7 days with 16S {rRNA} gene numbers on {LDPE} surfaces differing significantly across sediment types, as shown by quantitative {PCR}. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-{RFLP}) analysis demonstrated rapid selection of {LDPE}-associated bacterial assemblages whose structure and composition differed significantly from those in surrounding sediments. Additionally, T-{RFLP} analysis revealed successional convergence of the {LDPE}-associated communities from the different sediments over the 14-day experiment. Sequencing of cloned 16S {rRNA} genes demonstrated that these communities were dominated after 14 days by the genera Arcobacter and Colwellia (totalling 84–93\% of sequences). Attachment by Colwellia spp. onto {LDPE} within sediments was confirmed by {CARD}-{FISH}.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that bacteria within coastal marine sediments can rapidly colonize {LDPE} microplastics, with evidence for the successional formation of plastisphere-specific bacterial assemblages. Although the taxonomic compositions of these assemblages are likely to differ between marine sediments and the water column, both Arcobacter and Colwellia spp. have previously been affiliated with the degradation of hydrocarbon contaminants within low-temperature marine environments. Since hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have also been discovered on plastic fragments in seawater, our data suggest that recruitment of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria on microplastics is likely to represent a shared feature between both benthic and pelagic marine habitats.},

Microplastics (≤5-mm fragments) are rapidly emerging pollutants in marine ecosystems that may transport potentially toxic chemicals into macrobial food webs. This commentary evaluates our knowledge concerning the interactions between marine organisms and microplastics and identiﬁes the lack of microbial research into microplastic contamination as a signiﬁcant knowledge gap. Microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, and picoeukaryotes) in coastal sediments represent a key category of life with reference to understanding and mitigating the potential adverse effects of microplastics due to their role as drivers of the global functioning of the marine biosphere and as putative mediators of the biodegradation of plastic-associated additives, contaminants, or even the plastics themselves. As such, research into the formation, structure, and activities of microplastic-associated microbial bioﬁlms is essential in order to underpin management decisions aimed at safeguarding the ecological integrity of our seas and oceans.},

In order to elucidate the diversity of those macroalgae, and to establish a basis for detecting their new introduction to Northwestern Paciﬁc coasts, we have examined their species diversity by morphology and genetic identiﬁcations.

Most of them are known to be distributed in Japan and showed identical or very closely related genetic types to those of Tohoku, and conﬁrmed to be originated from the area. Several species such as Ceramium sungminbooi, Ectocarpus crouaniorum, Polysiphonia koreana, etc. have not been reported from Japan, but this is explained by the shortage of taxonomic information.},

From June 2012 to July 2016, we examined 42 heavily fouled debris items and, using both morphology and sequencing data, identiﬁed 84 species and varieties of marine algae and cyanobacteria on the debris. Many of these taxa had features that indicated a high invasion potential: 83\% were reproductive, 48\% were ephemeral, and 75\% were opportunistic forms. Naturally widespread species and 13 well-known global invaders were present. However, 61\% of the species or their genetic variants had been reported from the northeast Paciﬁc before the tsunami. Although the invasion risk was still deemed high, preventative debris removal appears to have been effective in averting many potential introductions.},

Microplastic is one of the marine debris types that need further attention due to its long term effect in marine life. The aim of the study was to investigate the microplastic transport in Java Sea, Indramayu for seven months period. The result showed that the tidal reversing current was dominant in Java Sea, with average current speed 0.04 – 0.32 m/s. The type of tidal movement in North Indramayu, Java Sea is mixed tide prevailing semidiurnal. The transport of microplastic has a circular-reversing pattern due to influences from the currents and waves. According to the result of this study, the start point of microplastics could be estimated ranges in distance 0.9 – 5.4 km from the location where they were sampled seven months later. Microplastic that currently resides in Java Sea allegedly came from South China Sea and Pacific Ocean. The result also indicates that Java Sea has a high probability to become the largest microplastic patch in Indonesia due to its reversing current, which can trap those particles for a long time (7 months microplastics mileage range of 1258.90 km – 1399.88 km), whether they originate from other ocean region or from Indonesia itself.},

Selecting areas, based on variable oceanographic and climatological drivers, rather than distance-based approaches, is proposed as a means to better understand the dynamics of this confounding variability in coastal environments. A pilot study conducted in Perth metropolitan waters aimed to explore the applicability of this approach, whilst quantifying levels of plastic pollution in an understudied part of the world. Pollution ranged from 950 to 60,000 pieces km−2 and was dominated by ﬁshing line. Offshore concentrations were highest with strongest Leeuwin Current ﬂow, in the estuary immediately after rainfall, and increased in the nearshore after estuarine outfall. Results elucidated signiﬁcant relationships between physical drivers and concentration changes and therefore their roles in increasing or decreasing local plastic pollution. Such observations can form the basis for predicting peak pollution periods and inform targeted mitigation.},

	abstract = {Over long periods of geological time the island rich {NE} Indian Ocean region has developed to be a region of high marine species richness but in the last few decades it has also become a generator of anthropogenic ﬂotsam. Plastic proved such a success, it was disposable, and is now transforming ocean surfaces and shorelines. Sea voyages, coastal conservation and remote island visits started raising awareness of the problems of rubbish at sea in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans. Household plastic items are now chieﬂy made in {SE} Asia and their use in that area where there is a very large human population density in contact with a large coastline results in disposable plastic items entering the surrounding seas. Surveys from Negombo in West Sri Lanka, Ari Atoll in the Maldives, Pemba Island in North Tanzania, Christmas Island, Cocos Island, Quirimba Island in North Mozambique, Rodrigues Island, Nosy Ve in South-West Madagascar and Inhaca Island in South Mozambique are reported. The accumulation of durable rubbish reaching even remote mid Ocean islands such as Christmas and Cocos islands is high and much of what was found stranded on shores was colonized by animals. The vast amounts of waterborne debris is almost certainly drastically changing opportunities for many marine organisms to travel and thus for exotic invaders to spread. Supralittoral hermit crabs on such remote Indian Ocean shores are even starting to use debris instead of the more usual gastropod shells as debris is so abundant. As in other oceans awareness of the problem and periodic clean up operations have grown but dumping at sea continues.},

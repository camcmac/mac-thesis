# Anthropogenic marine debris as habitat and pathway for range shifts and the introduction of invasive species
\chaptermark{AMD as habitat and pathway}

> "You can see the old cities, still everywhere, the bones and bricks go to dust, but the little pieces of plastic never do. They never adapt either."

## Introduction

Plastic pollution is altering marine ecosystems. At the ocean's surface, plastic and other materials manufactured by humans represent a large and growing proportion of floating material [@Koelmans2017] that can be used by plants, animals, and other organisms in ways that may fundamentally alter how they live. These organisms, known as neuston, are adapted to life within the dynamic boundary layer of water and air and the unique challenges it presents to their physiology. Neuston survive an environment with extreme fluctuations of temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability. The addition of anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) to this unique environment presents a significant shift in the availability of solid substrate, a previously limiting resource, and may therefore initiate shifts in both how it functions and interacts with the rest of the ocean.

80,10.1371/journal.pone.0215859,The Plastisphere – Uncovering tightly attached plastic “specific” microorganisms,Kirstein et al.,2019,N,Temp,Atl,Floating,Sample collection,C. Field,Macro,Distinct differences in both short and long term communities on different substrate types. All artificial substrates had different communities than found on glass. This is supposed to arise from the use of pressure washing to select for tightly attached organisms prior to culturing the community that would later be sequenced.

Numerous spp were found in only one site, despite sites being spatially very close to one another and diverse in and of themselves. Microplastic abundance correlated positively with human use of the beach."

They were grabbed and sampled for later lab identification according to protocol for the taxonomic group.  No organisms were metioned or seen in included photographs of non-fishing related items, a mattress and plastic bags.  Identifications were included in the same sentences as non-debris attached organisms and in photo captions."
86,10.1016/J.JNC.2018.01.005,Alert calling in port areas: Marine litter as possible secondary dispersal vector for hitchhiking invasive species,Miralles et al.,2018,N,Temp,Med,Beach,Transect,Obs,Macro,"Presence of metazoans on debris varied between 0 and 25% regionally with an average presence of 1.03% overall.  For all types of adhered organisms, the overall presence was 1.7%.  No difference in organisms was found between plastic bottles and ALDFG (study items). 127 ind. were found, 121 living and 6 dead, from 17 spp.  Identity was determined genetically for living orgs. 8/17 were NIS."
87,10.1371/journal.pone.0191859,Anthropogenic marine litter composition in coastal areas may be a predictor of potentially invasive rafting fauna,Rech et al.,2018,N,Temp,Med,Beach,Transect,Obs,Macro,"Over 90% of plastics in general were fouled, whereas non-plastics were fouled at a rate of about 6%.  Hard plastics had a higher diversity of attached organisms, whereas foams were dominated by goose barnacles.  Overall more than 3300 organisms (or colonies) were found attached to beach debris.  Barnacles (particularly goose) and the rafting adapted amphipod Caprella andreae were by far the most common.  Because most organisms were dead and/or decayed, only 2 cnidarians were idenfitied by genetic techniques.  Lepas positively correlated with motile rafters, negatively correlated with sessile."

This debris ended up primarily in rural and remote locations due to prevailing oceanographic patterns. Looked only broadly at colonising organisms on wood and amd to find presence of three groups: polychaetes, bryozoans, and barnacles.  ID only the most obvious."

Lab,Macro,Observed changes in microbial communities over time in lab conditions and associated weight loss due to microbial degradation in plastic fragments.  They also attempted to augment indigenous microbial communities with known hydrocarbon metabolising organisms to no notable success.  There was a significant change in the communities over time and all of the fragments were degraded by microbes.

Lab,Macro,"Again showed that the community on plastics, in this case PE, polyester of biological origin, and aged and unaged OXO, differed significantly from that of seawater.  It also showed that the productivity of commuinities on that plastic had a definitive pattern separated from the random pattern found in seawater.  Communities went through three distinct phases, also previously shown, of biofilm formation (creating surface for others to attach to), diverse secondary community, and the establishment of a third, stable and less diverse community.  Experiment was done in shallow pools of continuously refreshed natural seawater in the dark."
94,10.1016/J.MARPOLBUL.2018.09.033,Composition and abundance of benthic marine litter in a coastal area of the central Mediterranean Sea,Consoli et al.,2018,N,Temp,Med,Benthic,Trawl [Video],Obs,Macro,"Only 15% of items were ""highly fouled"" (>50% cover).  However, ROV imagery shown in the paper indicated that the photographed items would have been tough to notice due to the high cover of epibionts.  While two broad taxa were mentioned, the paper's phrasing suggested many more were seen."
95,10.1371/journal.pone.0206220,Deep-sea anthropogenic macrodebris harbours rich and diverse communities of bacteria and archaea,Woodall et al.,2018,N,Temp,Atl,Benthic,Trawl [Video],Obs,Macro,"Small number of samples  from wide spatial area so inter-material comparison is useless, though they copy-pasted some scripts and did it.  All materials were found with a diverse biofilm community different than the surrounding sediment. No macrofouling was noted.  Again, proteobacteria were dominant. Metal community was most distinct and least diverse.  Comparison to sediment was made, but not adjusted for in analyses."
96,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.04.014,"Deep-sea faunal communities associated with a lost intermodal shipping container in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, CA",Taylor et al.,2014,N,Temp,Pac,Benthic,Trawl [Video],Obs,Macro,"Patches of high density of macrofauna on a deep-sea submerged shipping container in Monterey Canyon meant that the area differed significantly in assemblage from the surrounding environment (>100m).  The assemblage is also different from that on natural substrata in the area due to the absence of soft corals, sponges, and crinoids.  Instead, the container hosted mollusca and higher divisions of life.  Authors suppose that containers such as this could provide habitat connectivity between distant rocky outcrops and coastlines."

Most common types were different than elsewhere in the world and indicative of a local source (polyurethane and polyamide).  Back tracking surface model also indicated that all were likely locally sourced within the past 7 years.  Fragments were most common shape.  Only n=2 out of n=78 were pellets. Found a lot of paint chips similar to Barnes results. However, total area sampled was less than 0.05km2 and total number of items found was accordingly very low."

Found more motile taxa than sessile.  Predominant feeding method was filter feeding, though omnivores and grazers were also common.  Taxa were not significantly different between years and locations. Almost 25% of taxa found were not previously known to raft. The larger the object the more rich the taxa, however this was not true for arthropods and bryozoans who hit maximum at mid-sized objects. Found several different types of eggs."

Field,Macro,"Observed biofilm structure using SEM, looked at OTUs, and compared where applicable between plastic, glass, and seawater. Differences observed between material types and listed OTUs to that level. Found that while plastic, glass, and particle attached were not overall different in community (PERMANOVA) that at the OTU level there were certain taxa that were significantly discriminant of material. Communities however, did differ significantly between the three materials and free-living organisms, seasons, and locations within the study (the two close stations were not different, but the far one was different from the neighboring two).  Found numerous taxa for the first time on artificial debris and several taxa commonly found in other studies (spatially distant) were not found."

Only looked at large plastics near their campsites. Field identification of what they already knew. Also found gastropod eggs, unidentified, similar to goldstein. Solid argument for the transport of Mytilus on plastic debris causing new introduction on Svalbard.  Larvae could likely not survive 2y in transit from Norwegian mainland to Svalbard and there is little boat traffic on coastline. Two experiential accounts of researchers has found Mytlius on debris, then this study documented it officially.  Non-plastic debris does not survive long enough to transport larvae.  Combination of warming waters and plastic debris likely caused introduction."
128,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.015,Travelling light: Fouling biota on macroplastics arriving on beaches of remote Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre,Rech et al.,2018,S,Temp,Pac,Beach,Opportunistic,Obs,Macro,"Majority of fouled items were fragments/unidentifiable objects, followed by rope.  Other fouled objects included plastic bottles/lids, plastic jerrycans/detergent container, crates/crate fragments, and fishing gear. Half had surface areas <100cm2 and half were on larger. Among fouled items, fouling was highly associated with surface area covered by bryozoans. Size of fragments and level of degradation suggest that they had been at sea for a long time, such as in the S. Pacific Gyre."

When items were found with nothing else, they were found with amoeboid protists and benthic foraminiferans, suggesting that these are the first to colonize plastics when they enter the marine environment. A variety of hydroid taxa were found on debris, however they were not able to be identified because the delicate structures that define them were damaged by beaching (hydranths and gonophores).  Most organisms are the same as those found on natural rafts.  Either suggests adapatation or could be due to the ready source of propagules"

138,10.3354/ab00151,Detached aquaculture buoys in the SE Pacific: Potential dispersal vehicles for associated organisms,Astudillo et al.,2009,S,Temp,Pac,Floating,Transect [Visual],Obs,Macro,"Determined wind driven transport and documented macrofouling taxa for abandoned buoys in the S. Pacific. Rare species occur more frequently on detached than attached buoys, therefore greater sample size is necessary to adequately describe the community. Number of rare species perhaps indicative of colonisation while detached due to randomness of encountering propagules. Mobile taxa were dependent on the presence and amount of sessile taxa, therefore are ""eco-engineers"". Found three invasive NIS on detached buoys, drift patterns and community analysis suggest that these buoys were colonised in a certain bay and drifted with the NIS attached. Detached buoys favoured suspension feeders and orgs without planktonic larvae (asexual, direct development)."

Field,Macro,"Found egg masses of invertebrates including molluscs, much like other studies. After 1000d, all plastics and foam remained floating despite fouling and degradation.  14 out of 18 pumice sank before 700d (1 broke apart and 1 was lost).  Dominant taxa on pumice, foam, and plastic was diatoms in caged (free floating), line (floating), and ring (submerged) trials. Peak richness occurred after 2 months. Communities were statistically consistent between surface types, except for plastic where balanus barnacle became dominant, which did not happen on others.  Almost all foam replicates in uncaged, floating experiment were lost to birds. Lack of floating stability likely inhibited community development on styrofoam, but not on plastic because they used two piece small sample cosmetic jars."

Abraded and degraded sample was able to be ID'd by a specialist because the colony was so large and established prior to beaching. Specimen supports theory of specialists that this coral has an amphi-Atlantic distribution due to its ability to raft.

Higher basal areas was slightly correlated with increased debris and debris diversity. Fouling communities also differed between debris on the forest floor and that caught within the roots. Root debris had a less diverse community dominated by periwinkles and barnacles. Floor litter tended to be a more diverse community predominated by sessile taxa. These communities also more strongly resembled communities from outside habitat, such as rocky intertidal, than those naturally occuring in mangrove forest. Hard debris more strongly showed this predominance of ""immigrant"" biota than soft debris."

An answer from unique biogenic reefs,Moschino et al.,2019,N,Temp,Adr,Benthic,Trawl [video],Obs,Macro,"Compared community on sites impacted by ALDFG and those not. Sites impacted by ALDFG tended to be rocky outcrops (places where nets frequently snagged or were lost). Once ALDFG was removed from sites, they did not return to the reference community within the 18 month timeframe of the study though there was apparent recolonisation of substrate by ""naturally occurring"" sponges and tunicates and a marked reduction in anthozoans. They found negligible evidence of ghost fishing in the gear they removed, meaning that the damage came from the ecological destruction of rocky outcrop communities by debris-caused shifts in physical structure and smothering. Differences were also seen within the nearby fish community."

Corals recieved the majority of the impacts. Once damaged, the corals then seemed to be used as habitat by fouling organisms, causing further damage. Yet a greater proportion of debris (80%) was itself fouled to some extent. The most fouled debris was ALDFG, which was also the most common, inflating numbers. Only 40% of non-ALDFG was fouled. Some of the organisms growing on the debris was again corals, including some of the species commonly abraded."

Biodiversity showed the same pattern. Community was significantly different between the two habitats but not between materials. Biomass stayed roughly consistent during the study on benthic samples, but increased sharply over the first 8 months on pelagic samples. Pelagic samples showed a marked decline in biomass between 8 and 12 months (could be due to season, this was transition summer-fall). Pelagic samples all reached negative buoyancy within 12 months. Most taxa on the plastic are also known to colonise poisodonia (found nearby)."
